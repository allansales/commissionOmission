ISPs may slow or block websites that disagree with the companies' political viewpoints or interfere with their monetary interests. 27 FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel stated that the removal of net neutrality rules will give ISPs \"extraordinary new power\" and allow them \"to censor online content.\" 8 According to the 2014 D.C. Circuit court ruling, Verizon v. FCC, the power of ISPs to censor content is not \"merely theoretical.\" Before net neutrality was in place, instances of content censorship actually occurred, including two separate instances of broadband ISPs blocking access to voice over IP applications, and one instance of an ISP blocking an online payment service. 15 In 2014, President Obama stated that \"an open Internet\u2026 has been one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known,\" and that if content is legal your ISP should not be allowed to block it. 33 The Electronic Freedom Foundation has argued that, \"the meaningful exercise of our constitutional rights\u2014including the freedoms of speech, assembly, and press\u2014has become dependent on broadband Internet access.\" This dependency makes net neutrality rules essential for a free society. 16", "Net neutrality protects consumers by preventing ISPs from speeding, slowing, or charging higher fees for select online content. Allowing ISPs to speed or slow certain websites, or charge fees for fast lane access, may eventually trickle down to consumers in the form of higher internet costs. For example, a person who gets their internet service from Comcast could be charged extra fees to stream Netflix or Amazon (companies not owned by Comcast), while not being charged extra to stream NBC or Hulu (two companies that Comcast partially owns). 21 According to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), without net neutrality, ISPs could \"cabel-ize\" the internet, meaning that \"instead of paying a flat price for access to use any app or service free of charge, companies could start bundling services into 'social,' 'video,' and so on,\" and consumers will have to pay for it. 23 On Apr. 27, 2017, one day after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced the plan to eliminate net neutrality, Comcast (the largest US ISP) removed it's pledge to not \"prioritize internet traffic or create paid fast lanes\" from its corporate website. 2011", "Net neutrality promotes competition by providing a level playing field for new companies. According to Internet Association President &amp; CEO Michael Beckerman, \"without net neutrality protections, startups would face discrimination from ISP owned or preferred content that\u2019s granted a speed advantage through paid prioritization,\" thus hurting competition and consumer choice. 1829 When the FCC implemented net neutrality rules in 2015, it warned \"that broadband providers hold all the tools necessary\" to \"degrade content, or disfavor the content that they don\u2019t like.\" 27 According to Ryan Singel, Fellow at the the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, without net neutrality \"broadband providers will be allowed to charge all websites and services, including startups, simply to reach an ISP\u2019s subscribers. That's a huge threat to the low cost of starting a company, and it totally up-ends the economics of the internet.\" 17 A group of over 1,000 startup companies, innovators, and investors signed a petition to the FCC stating that \"the success of America's startup ecosystem depends... on an open Internet\u2014including enforceable netneutrality rules.\" 19 Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said net neutrality principles must be protected \"for the next set of entrepreneurs, building their services and trying to reach users.\" 24", "Net neutrality regulations are unnecessary because the internet developed amazingly well in their absence.Most large internet companies including Google (1998), Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005), and Twitter (2006) were started and grew to success without net neutrality regulations. According to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, \"the internet wasn\u2019t broken in 2015,\" when net neutrality was implemented and \"it certainly wasn\u2019t heavy-handed government regulation\" that was responsible for the \"phenomenal development of the internet.\" 9 As FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly states \"periods without net neutrality rules were times of innovation and investment.\" 12 According to economist John W. Mayo, the entire rationale for net neutrality ignores the \"positive economic outcomes in the provision of internet services that resulted from twenty years of light-touch regulation.\" 32 As economist Gerald R. Faulhaber argues: \"we have had a decade of experience with broadband ISPs with little evidence of wrongdoing.\" 3 A 2017 statement from the Internet &amp; Television Association, signed by 21 large ISPs, stated they remain \"committed to an open internet\" and \"will not block, throttle or otherwise impair your online activity,\" once net neutrality regulations are removed. 14", "Net neutrality created burdensome and overreaching regulations to govern the internet. According to the bipartisan Telecommunications Act of 1996, \"the Internet and other interactive computer services have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of government regulation,\" and it should be the policy of the United States \"to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market... for the Internet and other interactive computer services unfettered by Federal or State regulation.\" 32 In 2017, the FCC reported that neutrality rules imposed significant and \"unnecessary\" reporting burdens on ISPs to prove they were in compliance. For example, the ISP CenturyLink estimated that meeting the net neutrality rules created over 5,000 hours of extra paperwork, costing over $134,000 each year. 10 In addition to being burdensome for ISPs, net neutrality regulations exceed the FCC's authority. According to the editors of the National Review, the net neutrality rules exceeded \"the agency's statutory mandate,\" and \"there is no title or provision in the Federal Communication Act that gives the agency a clear mandate to impose pricing and content-management rules on Internet providers, which is what net neutrality does.\" 31", "Net neutrality reduces investment in internet services resulting in less access and higher costs for consumers. Between 2011 and 2015, when neutrality rules were being debated by the FCC, the mere threat of implementing them reduced ISPs investments in network upgrades by 20-30%, a $150-$200 billion reduction in investment. 13 During the years that net neutrality rules were in place (2015-2017), investment in broadband fell for the first time ever in a non-recession period. 1028 According to AT&amp;T, that \"chilled investment in broadband,\" threatened \"to slow the delivery of broadband services to all Americans\u2026 particularly in rural America where broadband investment is needed the most.\" 30 Net neutrality regulations also prevent ISPs from charging large content companies (such as video streaming services) additional fees to cover the costs of the massive bandwidth they use. Preventing such paid prioritization fees places the costs of building the additional capacity necessary to carry the content onto ISPs, and these costs will trickle down to consumers in the form of more expensive internet packages - which are paid by all, even those who don't use the streaming services. 22"]},

Molecular biologist Hortense Dodo, PhD, genetically engineered a hypoallergenic peanut by suppressing the protein that can lead to a deadly reaction in people with peanut allergies. 12", "GMO crops lower the price of food and increase nutritional content, helping to alleviate world hunger.\n\nThe World Food Programme, a humanitarian organization, estimates that 821 million people in the world are chronically undernourished, and one in nine people face hunger. 13 Population growth, climate change, over-farming, and water shortages all contribute to food scarcity. 14 GMOs can help address those problems with genetic engineering to improve crop yields and help farmers grow food in drought regions or on depleted soil, thereby lowering food prices and feeding more people. 15 16\n\nDavid Zilberman, PhD, Professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley, said that GMO crops have \"raised the output of corn, cotton and soy by 20 to 30 percent, allowing some people to survive who would not have without it. If it were more widely adopted around the world, the price of food would go lower, and fewer people would die of hunger.\" 17\n\nTo combat Vitamin A deficiency, the main cause of childhood blindness in developing countries, researchers developed a GMO \u2018Golden Rice\u2019 that produces high levels of beta-carotene. 18 19 A report by Australia and New Zealand\u2019s food safety regulator found that Golden Rice \"is considered to be as safe for human consumption as food derived from conventional rice.\" 20", "Growing GMO crops leads to environmental benefits such as reduced pesticide use, less water waste, and lower carbon emissions.\n\nThe two main types of GMO crops in use today are engineered to either produce their own pesticides or to be herbicide-tolerant. 21 More than 80% of corn grown in the US is GMO Bt corn, which produces its own Bacillus thuringiensis insecticide. 22 This has significantly reduced the need for spraying insecticides over corn fields, and dozens of studies have shown there are no environmental or health concerns with Bt corn. 23\n\nDrought-tolerant varieties of GMO corn have been shown to reduce transpiration (evaporation of water off plants) by up to 17.5%, meaning less water waste. 24\n\nHerbicide-tolerant (Ht) GMO soy crops have reduced the need to till the soil to remove weeds. 26 Tilling is a process that involves breaking up the soil, which brings carbon to the surface. When that carbon mixes with oxygen in the atmosphere, it becomes carbon dioxide and contributes to global warming. 25 Reduced tilling preserves topsoil, reduces soil erosion and water runoff (keeping fertilizers out of the water supply), and lowers carbon emissions. 27 2829 The decreased use of fuel and tilling as a result of growing GM crops can lower greenhouse gas emissions as much as removing 12 million cars from the roads each year. 30", "Genetically modified (GM) crops have not been proven safe for human consumption through human clinical trials.\n\nGenetically modified ingredients are in 70-80% of food eaten in the United States, even though there haven\u2019t been any long term clinical trials on humans to determine whether GMO foods are safe. 31 32\n\nScientists still don\u2019t know what the long-term effects of significant GMO consumption could be. Robert Gould, MD, a pathologist at the UC San Francisco School of Medicine, said, \"the contention that GMOs pose no risks to human health can't be supported by studies that have measured a time frame that is too short to determine the effects of exposure over a lifetime.\" 33\n\nAccording to the Center for Food Safety, a US-based nonprofit organization, \"Each genetic insertion creates the added possibility that formerly nontoxic elements in the food could become toxic.\" The group says that resistance to antibiotics, cancer, and suppressed immune function are among potential risks of genetic modification using viral DNA. 34", "Tinkering with the genetic makeup of plants may result in changes to the food supply that introduce toxins or trigger allergic reactions.\n\nAn article in Food Science and Human Welfare said, \"Three major health risks potentially associated with GM foods are: toxicity, allergenicity and genetic hazards.\" The authors raised concerns that the GMO process could disrupt a plant's genetic integrity, with the potential to activate toxins or change metabolic toxin levels in a ripple effect beyond detection. 35\n\nA joint commission of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) identified two potential unintended effects of genetic modification of food sources: higher levels of allergens in a host plant that contains known allergenic properties, and new proteins created by the gene insertion that could cause allergic reactions. 36\n\nThe insertion of a gene to modify a plant can cause problems in the resulting food. After StarLink corn was genetically altered to be insect-resistant, there were several reported cases of allergic reactions in consumers. The reactions ranged from abdominal pain and diarrhea to skin rashes to life-threatening issues. 37", "Certain GM crops harm the environment through the increased use of toxic herbicides and pesticides. \n\nSince herbicide-resistant GM crop varieties were developed in 1996, an \"epidemic of super-weeds\" has developed resistance to the herbicides that GM crops were designed to tolerate. 38 Those weeds are choking crops on over 60 million acres of US croplands, and the solution being presented to farmers is to use more herbicides. 39 This has led to a tenfold increase in the use of the weed killer Roundup, which is made by Monsanto, the largest GMO seed producer. 3338 \n\nThe increased use of the weed killer glyphosate can harm pollinating insects and potentially create health risks for humans ingesting traces of herbicides used on GM crops. 41 When glyphosate is used near rivers, local wildlife is impacted. The use of Roundup, whose active ingredient is glyphosate, can lead to higher mortality rates among amphibians. 42 Scientists blame Roundup for a 90% decrease in the US monarch butterfly population. 38\n\nA report from the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network found that \"GM crops have also had a number of impacts on biodiversity.

A study of Louisiana's voucher program found that the program reduced racial segregation, a feat in a state with 34 school districts under federal desegregation orders. 6 Many families use vouchers to avoid the \"school-to-prison pipeline,\" the phenomenon in which children of color are poorly educated, subjected to racist treatment, and treated like criminals in schools often ruled by gangs. 17 These children deserve better, and vouchers empower students to overcome racial and other disparities in their communities.", "School vouchers offer students in failing schools access to a better education. Parents who cannot afford homes in neighborhoods with great school districts are often doomed to send their kids to bad schools with less funding, fewer good teachers, and fewer opportunities for students to excel. 8 The DC voucher program, the only federally-funded school voucher program in the country, increased students' graduation rates by 21% overall and 28% for female voucher students. 16 Parents of DC voucher recipients reported high levels of satisfaction, felt the school was safer than their public school option, and were more likely to give the school an A or B grade. 16 EdChoice, an education nonprofit, stated, \"The empirical evidence shows that choice improves academic outcomes for participants and public schools\u2026 and strengthens the shared civic values and practices essential to American democracy.\" 20", "Tax dollars are intended for the better secular education of all children, not the private religious education of a few. Using public funds to subsidize religious schools violates the separation of church and state. Of the 14 states with school voucher programs, 11 allow vouchers to be used at religious schools (Maine and Vermont do not). 2 According to an EdChoice survey of parents who use vouchers, the number one reason parents chose to use vouchers was \"religious environment/instruction.\" 4 An estimated 85% of Milwaukee voucher students attended religious schools, with each Catholic school that accepted voucher students getting about $1 million in taxpayer dollars. 1314", "School vouchers funnel money away from already-struggling public schools and children and redistribute tax dollars to private schools and middle-class children. Superintendent of Fort Wayne, Indiana Schools, Wendy Robinson, Ed.D, calls school vouchers \"an assault on public education.\" 49 In Indiana the voucher program now costs the state approximately $50 million more in state money going to education costs than originally budgeted. 4 One third of Indiana voucher students were not considered low-income, and, increasingly, the voucher students are from suburban, middle class families who already have access to good public schools. 4 Only 1% of Indiana voucher students were leaving failing schools. 4 Families who have the means to send their children to private schools should be responsible for the resulting bills instead of taking money from public school kids.", "School vouchers fail to accommodate and support disabled and special-needs students. Public schools are required by law to offer a wide range of free services to students who need extra or enhanced instruction, special services or equipment, or other educational accommodations. Private schools do not have those same requirements.

Children are better able to make decisions about their behavior, exercise self-control, and be accountable for their actions when they understand the penalty they face for misbehaving is comparable to their actions. 24 Harold Bennet, PhD, President and Dean of the Charles H. Mason Theological Seminary, stated, \"children need to understand boundaries and I think that children need to understand that there should be punishments... in direct proportion to the improper behavior that they might demonstrate.\" 16 Some experts state that corporal punishment prevents children from persisting in their bad behavior and growing up to be criminals. 27", "Corporal punishment is often chosen by students over suspension or detention. When given the choice, students frequently choose corporal punishment because it is a quick punishment that doesn't cause older children to miss class or other activities, or younger children to miss their valued time on the playground. 26 The child's education is not interrupted and make-up work is not required for missed class instruction. Allison Collins, a high school senior at Robbinsville High School in North Carolina, stated she chose corporal punishment over in-school suspension when her phone rang in class. 26 Her principal, David Matheson, stated, \"Most kids will tell you that they choose the paddling so they don't miss class.\" 26", "Corporal punishment can inflict long-lasting physical and mental harm on students.

The American Academy of Pediatrics says corporal punishment \"may contribute to disruptive and violent student behavior.\" 11 Children who experience corporal punishment are more likely to hit or use other violence against people in order to get their way, putting other children at risk for increased bullying and physical abuse and teachers in potentially violent classrooms. 1718 The American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry states, \"corporal punishment signals to the child that a way to settle interpersonal conflicts is to use physical force and inflict pain. Such children may in turn resort to such behavior themselves.\" 10", "Corporal punishment is an inappropriate punishment that harms the education of children. Corporal punishment has been banned in US prisons and military training, and animals are protected from the same sort of punishment in every state. 14 Students who experience corporal punishment in kindergarten are more likely to have lower vocabulary scores in fourth grade and lower fifth grade math scores. 17 According to the National Women's Law Center, \"Harsh physical punishments do not improve students' in-school behavior or academic performance.

Legally, the conflict regarding access for UN inspectors and possible Iraqi procurement of 'weapons of mass destruction' (WMDs) had always been between Iraq and the United Nations, not between Iraq and the United States.

Brutal as Saddam Hussein\u2019s reign had been, the scope of the Iraqi government\u2019s killing in March 2003 was not of the exceptional and dire magnitude that would justify humanitarian intervention. We have no illusions about Saddam Hussein\u2019s vicious inhumanity. Having devoted extensive time and effort to documenting his atrocities, we estimate that in the last twenty-five years of Ba'th Party rule the Iraqi government murdered or 'disappeared' some quarter of a million Iraqis, if not more... There were times in the past when the killing was so intense that humanitarian intervention would have been justified... But on the eve of the latest Iraq war, no one contends that the Iraqi government was engaged in killing of anywhere near this magnitude, or had been for some time. 'Better late than never' is not a justification for humanitarian intervention, which should be countenanced only to stop mass murder, not to punish its perpetrators, desirable as punishment is in such circumstances.\"", "\"Nothing in international law authorizes a preemptive war to overthrow a government and disarm it.

The report did not find a relationship between playing violent video games and school shootings. 35 An Apr. 2015 peer-reviewed study published in Psychiatric Quarterly found that playing violent video games had no impact on hostility levels in teenagers. 123 Read More", "Violent video games allow players to release their stress and anger (catharsis) in the game, leading to less real world aggression.\nA peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health found that children, especially boys, play video games as a means of managing their emotions: \"61.9% of boys played to 'help me relax,' 47.8% because 'it helps me forget my problems,' and 45.4% because 'it helps me get my anger out.\" 37 Researchers point to the cathartic effect of video games as a possible reason for why higher game sales have been associated with lower crime rates. 84 A peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Adolescent Research concluded that \"Boys use games to experience fantasies of power and fame, to explore and master what they perceive as exciting and realistic environments (but distinct from real life), to work through angry feelings or relieve stress, and as social tools.\"36 The games serve as a substitute for rough-and-tumble play. 36 Read More", "Violent video game players know the difference between virtual violence in the context of a game and appropriate behavior in the real world.\nBy age seven, children can distinguish fantasy from reality, and can tell the difference between video game violence and real-world violence. 99100 Video game players understand they are playing a game. Kids see fantasy violence all the time, from Harry Potter and the Minions to Bugs Bunny and Tom and Jerry. Their ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality prevents them from emulating video game violence in real life. 9 Exposure to fantasy is important for kids. Fisher-Price toy company stated: \"Pretending is more than play: it's a major part of a child's development. Fantasy not only develops creative thinking, it's also a way for children to deal with situations and problems that concern them.\" 108 Read More", "Studies have shown that violent video games can have a positive effect on kindness, civic engagement, and \u201cprosocial\u201d behaviors.\nResearch shows that playing violent video games can induce a feeling of guilt that leads to increased prosocial behavior (positive actions that benefit others) in the real world. 104 Another study published in Computers in Human Behavior discovered that youths exposed to violence in action games displayed more prosocial behavior and civic engagement, \"possibly due to the team-oriented multiplayer options in many of these games.\" 103 In a 2013 peer-reviewed study published in PLOS ONE, \"Three experiments failed to find a detrimental effect of violent video games on prosocial behavior positive actions taken to benefit others, despite using contemporary and classic games, delayed and immediate test-phases, and short and long exposures.\" 102 Researchers have shown that playing video games also results in increased moral sensitivity. 104 Read More", "Nearly all young men play video games, so the fact that some people who commit violent acts also played games should not be surprising, nor does it imply a causal relationship.\nAn estimated four out of five US households with a male child own a video game system. Although boys play an average of nine hours per week, 84 only a small percentage of them display violent behavior. Patrick M. Markey, PhD, Director of the Interpersonal Research Laboratory at Villanova University, stated, \"90% of young males play video games. Finding that a young man who committed a violent crime also played a popular video game, such as Call of Duty, Halo, or Grand Theft Auto, is as pointless as pointing out that the criminal also wore socks.\" 84 Read More", "Many risk factors are associated with youth violence, but video games are not among them.\nThe US Surgeon General's list of risk factors for youth violence included abusive parents, poverty, neglect, neighborhood crime, being male, substance use, and mental health problems, but not video games. 118 A peer-reviewed study even found a \"real and significant\" effect of hot weather on homicides and aggravated assaults, showing that heat is a risk factor for violence. 124Smoking is a known risk factor for lung cancer, but there is no good evidence that video game playing is a risk factor for violence. An Aug. 2014 peer-reviewed study published in Psychology of Popular Media Culture pointed out that \"As more people have been exposed to violent video games, serious and deadly assaults have not increased.\" 84 A 2014 peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Communication also found that as video game playing increased, there was less youth violence. 93 Read More", "Violent video games provide opportunities for children to explore virtually the consequences of violent actions and to develop their moral compasses.\nViolent games allow youth to experiment with moral issues such as war, violence, and death without real world consequences. 38 A researcher at the Harvard Medical School Center for Mental Health and Media wrote about her research: \"One unexpected theme that came up multiple times in our focus groups was a feeling among boys that violent games can teach moral lessons... Many war-themed video games allow or require players to take the roles of soldiers from different sides of a conflict, perhaps making players more aware of the costs of war.\" 2 Read More", "Violent video games may decrease crime because people are busy playing the games instead of committing violent acts.\nSome researchers say that violent people often seek out violent video games, and that the time they spend playing the games is taking them off the streets, leading to decreased crime. This is known as the \"incapacitation effect.\" 84 Steven Levitt, PhD, economics professor at the University of Chicago and co-author of Freakonomics, stated, \"It just stands to reason that if you find an activity that keeps potential criminals busy for six waking hours a day, then it probably makes sense that they're going to be doing less crime.\" 89 One study estimated that this effect leads to about ten fewer crimes per day nationwide. 90 Read More", "Gun violence is less prevalent in countries with high video game use.\nPer capita video game sales were $5.20 in the United States compared to $47 in Japan. In 2005, the United States had 2,279 murders committed by teenagers (27.9 per million residents) compared to 73 in Japan (3.1 per million).111213 A study of the countries representing the 10 largest video game markets internationally found no correlation between playing video games and gun-related killings. 97 Even though US gun violence is high, the nine other countries with the highest video game usage have some of the lowest violent crime rates (and eight of those countries spend more per capita on video games than the United States). 97 Read More", "The competitive nature of a video game is what arouses aggression, not the level of violent content.\nA peer-reviewed study in Psychology of Violence determined that the competitive nature of a video game was related to aggressive behavior, regardless of whether the game contained violent content or not. The researchers concluded: \"Because past studies have failed to equate the violent and nonviolent video games on competitiveness, difficulty, and pace of action simultaneously, researchers may have attributed too much of the variability in aggression to the violent content.\" 125 A follow-up study tracked high school students for four years and came to the same conclusion: the competitive nature of the games led to the increased hostile behavior. 126 Read More", "Older generations often unfairly disparage new things that youth like, such as video games.\nThe \"moral panic\" that many adults feel about video games is an exaggerated sense of public concern, fear, and anxiety over a perceived threat of social corruption. 113 Other examples of moral panic from history include rock and roll, comic books, radio, television, cell phone use, and social media. 114 An Oct. 2013 study in Psychology of Popular Media Culture found that people who had no experience playing video games were six times more likely to believe the games contributed to mass shootings. Older Americans were five times more likely than young people to think that the games caused mass shootings. 116 The 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooter, for example, was originally and incorrectly reported to be an avid player of violent video games. Investigators later showed that the shooter's favorite games were Super Mario Brothers, Dance, Dance Revolution, and other non-violent video games. 115 Read More"]},

A 1994 study by economists Alan Krueger, PhD, and David Card, PhD, compared employment in the fast food industry after New Jersey raised its minimum wage by 80 cents, while Pennsylvania did not. Krueger and Card observed that job growth in the fast food industry was similar in both states, and found \"no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.\" 3 Their findings were corroborated by economists Hristos Doucouliagos, PhD, and T.D.

The Center for American Progress reported in 2014 that raising the federal minimum wage by 6% to $10.10 would reduce spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) by 6% or $4.6 billion. 9 The Economic Policy Institute determined that by increasing the minimum wage to $10.10, more than 1.7 million Americans would no longer be dependent on government assistance programs. They report the increase would shave $7.6 billion off annual government spending on income-support programs. 10 Read More", "The minimum wage has not kept up with inflation.\nBecause the federal minimum wage is not indexed for inflation, its purchasing power (the number of goods that can be bought with a unit of currency) has dropped considerably since its peak in 1968. The minimum wage in 1968 was $1.60, which is equivalent to $11.16 in Jan. 2016 dollars and which is 53.9% higher than today's $7.25 federal minimum wage. 7 11 Between July 2015 and the last increase in the minimum wage in 2009, the federal minimum wage lost 8.1% of its purchasing power to inflation. 7 12 According to Liana Fox, PhD, Senior Analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, \"inflation indexing guarantees low-wage workers a wage that keeps pace with the rising costs of goods and services.\" 13 Raising the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation would ensure that low-wage workers could adopt a standard of living commensurate with the current economy. 14 15 16 Read More", "Improvements in productivity and economic growth have outpaced increases in the minimum wage.\nWhile the estimates of how much the minimum wage should be increased vary, many economists agree that if it had kept pace with rising productivity and incomes, it would be higher than the current $7.25 an hour. According to a study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), the federal minimum wage would have been $21.72 per hour in 2012, instead of $7.25, if the minimum wage had kept pace with increases in productivity since 1968. 17 The Institute for Policy Studies estimated in 2012 that personal income has grown by 100.6% since 1968, while the minimum wage has stagnated: \"If our standard for minimum wages had kept pace with overall income growth in the American economy, it would now be $21.16 per hour.\" 14 The Economist stated in 2015 that \"America as a whole is an outlier among advanced economies... one would expect America, where GDP per person is $53,000, to pay a minimum wage around $12 an hour.

Kearney, PhD, and Benjamin Harris, PhD, of the Brookings Institution found that increasing the minimum wage would result in higher wages not only for the 3.7 million people earning minimum wage, but also for up to 35 million workers who make up to 150% of the federal minimum wage. 28 Researchers at the White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) found that an increase to $10.10 an hour would raise wages for 28 million Americans\u2013about nine million of those due to the ripple effect. 29 Read More", "Increasing the minimum wage would increase worker productivity and reduce employee turnover.\nIncreases in wages are associated with increased productivity, according to many economists, including Janet Yellen, PhD, Chair of the Federal Reserve. 30 Alan Manning, DPhil, Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics, stated in 2014: \"As the minimum wage rises and work becomes more attractive, labor turnover rates and absenteeism tend to decline.\" 31 A 2014 University of California at Berkeley study found \"striking evidence that... turnover rates for teens and restaurant workers fall substantially following a minimum wage increase,\" declining by about 2% for a 10% increase in the minimum wage. 32 A 2014 survey found that 53% of small business owners believed that \"with a higher minimum wage, businesses would benefit from lower employee turnover and increased productivity and customer satisfaction.\" 33 Read More", "The current minimum wage is not high enough to allow people to afford housing.\nAccording to a 2015 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a worker must earn at least $15.50 an hour (over twice the federal minimum wage) to be able to afford to rent a \"modest\" one-bedroom apartment, and $19.35 for a two-bedroom unit (more than 2.5 times the minimum wage). The report stated: \"In no state can an individual working a typical 40-hour work week at the federal minimum wage afford a one- or two-bedroom apartment for his or her family.\" In California in 2015, even a person earning the then state minimum wage of $9 per hour would need to work 92 hours a week to afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment. 34 In Rawlins County, Kansas, where rental costs are some of the most affordable in the country, a living wage including housing costs for one person with no dependents is estimated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to be $9.35, 25.3% higher than the federal minimum wage and the state minimum wage of Kansas. 35 Read More", "The current minimum wage is not high enough to allow people to afford everyday essentials.\nAccording to a 2013 poll by Oxfam America, 66% of US workers earning less than $10 an hour report that they \"just meet\" or \"don't even have enough to meet\" their basic living expenses, and 50% say that they are frequently worried about affording basic necessities such as food. 36 A 2015 report by the Alliance for a Just Society, found that \"the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour represents less than half of a living wage for a single adult\" and a worker supporting only himself would have to work 93 hours a week at the federal minimum wage in order to make ends meet \"or skip necessities like meals or medicine.\" 37 Read More", "Raising the minimum wage would lead to a healthier population and prevent premature deaths.\nA 2014 Human Impact Partners study by Rajiv Bhatia, MD, found that raising the Californian minimum wage to $13 an hour by 2017 would \"significantly benefit health and well-being.\" 38 The study found that those earning a higher minimum wage would have enough to eat, be more likely to exercise, less likely to smoke, suffer from fewer emotional and psychological problems, and even prevent 389 premature deaths a year. 38 A 2014 study by the Bay Area Regional Health Inequities Initiative (BARHII) found that minimum wage workers are more likely to report poor health, suffer from chronic diseases, and be unable to afford balanced meals. 39 The study concluded that \"policies that reduce poverty and raise the wages of low-income people can be expected to significantly improve overall health and reduce health inequities.\" 39 Edward Ehlinger, MD, State Health Commissioner for Minnesota, stated that raising the Minnesotan minimum wage from $6.15 an hour to $9.50 by mid-2016 was probably \"the biggest public health achievement... in the four years I've been health commissioner...

Teens who live in poverty are twice as likely to miss three or more days of school per month compared to those who do not; thus raising the minimum wage and lifting families out of poverty would mean children would miss fewer school days. The study found that \"recent experimental studies show that increasing income can improve school performance.\" 38 Increasing the minimum wage would allow teens to work fewer hours for the same amount of pay giving them more time to study and reducing the likelihood that they would drop out of high school.

To actually buy a gun, customers have to show proof of honest income, provide references, pass a criminal background check, prove any military duties were completed with honor, and be fingerprinted and photographed. If allowed to purchase a gun, the customer may buy only one gun (choosing from only .38 caliber pistols or lower) and one box of bullets. 909293 Between 2006 and 2010, Mexico's one gun shop sold 6,490 guns, 92 yet as of 2012, Mexicans own about 15,000,000 guns, or about 13.5 guns per 100 people. 44 Read More", "Gun control laws are racist.\nCurrent gun control laws are frequently aimed at inner city, poor, black communities who are perceived as more dangerous than white gun owners. 9495 Charles Gallagher, MA, PhD, the Chair of Sociology at LaSalle University, stated that some gun control laws are still founded on racial fears: \"Whites walking down Main Street with an AK-47 are defenders of American values; a black man doing the same thing is Public Enemy No. 1.\" 96 In the late 1960s, gun control laws were enacted in reaction to the militant, gun-carrying Black Panthers. 97 Adam Winkler, MA, JD, UCLA Constitutional Law Professor, stated \"The KKK began as a gun-control organization.

This finding was endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 1 which stated that that there is \"no legitimate scientific information that supports the statement that a fetus experiences pain.\" 142 A University of California at San Francisco study said fetuses probably can't feel pain until the 29th or 30th week of gestation. 166 Abortions that late into a pregnancy are extremely rare and are often restricted by state laws. 164 According to Stuart W.

Mishell, Jr., MD, Chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, before abortion was legalized women would frequently try to induce abortions by using coat hangers, knitting needles, or radiator flush, or by going to unsafe \"back-alley\" abortionists. 150 In 1972, there were 39 maternal deaths from illegal abortions. By 1976, after Roe v.

The study also found that \"pregnancy-related complications were more common with childbirth than with abortion.\" 3 The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated \"Abortion is one of the safest medical procedures performed in the United States.\" They also said the mortality rate of a colonoscopy is more than 40 times greater than that of an abortion. 122 The National Cancer Institute (NCI), the American Cancer Society (ACS), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists all refuted the claim that abortion can lead to a higher probability of developing breast cancer. 22 A fertility investigation of 10,767 women by the Joint Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that women who had at least two abortions experienced the same future fertility as those who had at least two natural pregnancies. 14 Read More", "Women who receive abortions are less likely to suffer mental health problems than women denied abortions.\nA peer-reviewed study comparing the mental health of women who received abortions to women denied abortions found that women who were denied abortions \"felt more regret and anger\" and \"less relief and happiness\" than women who had abortions. The same study also found that 95% of women who received abortions \"felt it was the right decision\" a week after the procedure. 158 Studies by the American Psychological Association (APA), the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AMRC), and researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health all concluded that purported links between abortion and mental health problems are unfounded. 152 Read More", "Abortion gives pregnant women the option to choose not to bring fetuses with profound abnormalities to full term.\nSome fetuses have such severe disorders that death is guaranteed before or shortly after birth.

Also, since many women seeking late-term abortions are economically disadvantaged, their children are likely to require welfare assistance. 129 130 Read More", "Abortion reduces crime.\nAccording to a study co-written by Freakonomics co-author Steven D. Levitt, PhD, and published in the peer-reviewed Quarterly Journal of Economics, \"legalized abortion has contributed significantly to recent crime reductions.\" Around 18 years after abortion was legalized, crime rates began to drop abruptly, and crime rates dropped earlier in states that allowed abortion earlier. Because \"women who have abortions are those most at risk to give birth to children who would engage in criminal activity,\" and women who had control over the timing of childbearing were more likely to raise children in optimal environments, crime is reduced when there is access to legal abortion. 20 Read More", "Abortion is justified as a means of population control.\nPhilosopher Peter Singer, MA, Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, defended abortion as a way to curb overpopulation. 137 The United Nations estimated that the world's population will increase to 9.3 billion by 2050, which would be \"the equivalent of adding another India and China to the world,\" according to the Los Angeles Times. 131 Malnutrition, starvation, poverty, lack of medical and educational services, pollution, underdevelopment, and conflict over resources are all consequences of overpopulation. 21 With 55.9 million abortions performed worldwide each year, 202, the population increase if abortion were unavailable could be substantial. 132 Read More", "Many religious organizations and people of faith support women\u2019s reproductive choice.\nAlthough many religious groups oppose abortion, the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations are all officially pro-choice. 139 140 141 The Bible, despite interpretations to the contrary, contains no explicit condemnation of abortion, and does not portray the killing of a fetus as equivalent to the killing of a human being. In Exodus 21:22-25, the crime of causing a woman to miscarry is treated as a property crime, whereas killing the woman is considered murder and is punished with the death penalty. 33 While the Catholic and Lutheran churches oppose abortion, more of their members believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases versus illegal in all or most cases (51% vs. 45%, Lutheran; 48% vs. 45%, Catholic). 151 Joe Biden, 47th US Vice President, stated that \"I accept my Catholic church's position on abortion...

On Dec. 17, 2009 the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the cost to the federal government of extending employment benefits to same-sex domestic partners of certain federal employees (making no mention of additional costs such as Social Security and inheritance taxes) would be $596 million in mandatory spending and $302 million in discretionary spending between 2010 and 2019. 37 Read More", "Marriage is a privilege, not a right.\nThe US Constitution contains no explicit right to marry. 99 The European Court of Human Rights ruled on June 24, 2010 that the state has a valid interest in protecting the traditional definition of marriage, and stated that the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms \"enshrined the traditional concept of marriage as being between a man and a woman.\" 101 102 Society can choose not to allow same-sex couples to marry, just as it does not allow a person to marry more than one partner or allow minors or close relatives to marry. 100 Matthew D.

Water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas. 112 In a process known as a positive feedback loop, more warming causes more humidity which causes even more warming. 113 Higher humidity levels also cause changes in precipitation. According to a 2013 report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the recorded changes in precipitation over land and oceans \"are unlikely to arise purely due to natural climate variability.\" 48 Higher temperatures from global warming are also causing some mountainous areas to receive rain rather than snow. According to researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, up to 60% of the changes in river flow, winter air temperature, and snow pack in the western United States (1950-1999) were human-induced. 111 Since 1991, heavy precipitation events have been 30% above the 1901-1960 average in the Northeast, Midwest, and upper Great Plains regions. 16 A 2015 study found that global warming caused by human actions has increased extreme precipitation events by 18% across the globe, and that if temperatures continue to rise an increase of 40% can be expected. 174 Read More", "Permafrost is melting at unprecedented rates due to global warming, causing further climate changes.\nAccording to a 2013 IPCC report there is \"high confidence\" (about an 8 out of 10 chance) that anthropogenic global warming is causing permafrost, a subsurface layer of frozen soil, to melt in high-latitude regions and in high-elevation regions. 49 As permafrost melts it releases methane, a greenhouse gas that absorbs 84 times more heat than CO2 for the first 20 years it is in the atmosphere, creating even more global warming in a positive feedback loop. 5051 By the end of the 21st century, warming temperatures in the Arctic will cause a 30%-70% decline in permafrost. 52 According to a 2012 report, as human-caused global warming continues, Arctic air temperatures are expected to increase at twice the global rate, increasing the rate of permafrost melt, changing the local hydrology, and impacting critical habitat for native species and migratory birds. 53 According to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, some climate models suggest that near-surface permafrost will be \"lost entirely\" from large parts of Alaska by the end of the 21st century. 16 Read More", "More than one thousand scientists disagree that human activity is primarily responsible for global climate change.\nIn 2010 Climate Depot released a report featuring more than 1,000 scientists, several of them former UN IPCC scientists, who disagreed that humans are primarily responsible for global climate change. 55 The Cook review 1 of 11,944 peer-reviewed studies found 66.4% of the studies had no stated position on anthropogenic global warming, and while 32.6% of the studies implied or stated that humans are contributing to climate change, only 65 papers (0.5%) explicitly stated \"that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming.\" 54 A 2012 Purdue University survey found that 47% of climatologists challenge the idea that humans are primarily responsible for climate change and instead believe that climate change is caused by an equal combination of humans and the environment (37%), mostly by the environment (5%), or that there\u2019s not enough information to say (5%). 173 In 2014 a group of 15 scientists dismissed the US National Climate Assessment as a \"masterpiece of marketing,\" that was \"grossly flawed,\" and called the NCA\u2019s assertion of human-caused climate change \"NOT true.\" 56 Read More", "Earth\u2019s climate has always warmed and cooled, and the 20th century rise in global temperature is within the bounds of natural temperature fluctuations over the past 3,000 years.\nAlthough the planet has warmed 1-1.4\u00b0F over the 20th century, it is within the +/- 5\u00b0F range of the past 3,000 years. 114 A 2003 study by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics found that \"many records reveal that the 20th century is probably not the warmest nor a uniquely extreme climatic period of the last millennium.\" 115 A 2005 study published in Nature found that \"high temperatures - similar to those observed in the twentieth century before 1990 - occurred around AD 1000 to 1100\" in the Northern Hemisphere. 116 A 2013 study published in Boreas found that summer temperatures during the Roman Empire and Medieval periods were \"consistently higher\" than temperatures during the 20th century. 59 According to a 2010 study in the Chinese Science Bulletin, the recent global warming period of the 20th century is the result of a natural 21-year temperature oscillation, and will give way to a \"new cool period in the 2030s.\" 74 Read More", "Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 do not necessarily cause global warming, which contradicts the core thesis of human-caused climate change.\nEarth's climate record shows that warming has preceded, not followed, a rise in CO2.

If models cannot replicate past climate changes they should not be trusted to predict future climate changes. 58 A 2011 Asia-Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Science study using observational data rather than computer climate models concluded that \"the models are exaggerating climate sensitivity\" and overestimate how fast the earth will warm as CO2 levels increase. 75 Two other studies using observational data found that IPCC projections of future global warming are too high. 76 97 In a 2014 article, climatologist and former NASA scientist Roy Spencer, PhD, concluded that 95% of climate models have \"over-forecast the warming trend since 1979.\" 77 According to Emeritus Professor of Geography at the University of Winnipeg, Tim Ball, PhD, \"IPCC computer climate models are the vehicles of deception\u2026 They create the results they are designed to produce.\" 78 Read More", "Glaciers have been growing and receding for thousands of years due to natural causes, not human activity.\nThe IPCC predicted that Himalayan glaciers would likely melt away by 2035, a prediction they disavowed in 2010. 83 In 2014 a study of study of 2,181 Himalayan glaciers from 2000-2011 showed that 86.6% of the glaciers were not receding. 84 According to a 2013 study of ice cores published in Nature Geoscience, the current melting of glaciers in Western Antarctica is due to \"atmospheric circulation changes\" that have \"caused rapid warming over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet\" and cannot be directly attributed to human caused climate change. 85 According to one of the study authors, \"if we could look back at this region of Antarctica in the 1940s and 1830s, we would find that the regional climate would look a lot like it does today, and I think we also would find the glaciers retreating much as they are today.\" 86 According to Christian Schl\u00fcchter, Professor of Geology at the University of Bern, 4,000 year old tree remains have been found beneath retreating glaciers in the Swiss Alps, indicating that they were previously glacier-free. According to Schl\u00fcchter, the current retreat of glaciers in the Alps began in the mid-19th century, before large amounts of human caused CO2 had entered the atmosphere. 87 Read More", "Deep ocean currents, not human activity, are a primary driver of natural climate warming and cooling cycles.\nChanges in ocean currents are primarily responsible for the melting Greenland ice sheet, Arctic sea ice, and Arctic permafrost. Over the 20th century there have been two Arctic warming periods with a cooling period (1940-1970) in between. According to a 2009 study in Geophysical Research Letters, natural shifts in the ocean currents are the major cause of these climate changes, not human-generated greenhouse gases. 124 According to William Gray, PhD, Emeritus Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, most of the climate changes over the last century are natural and \"due to multi-decadal and multi-century changes in deep global ocean currents.\" 122 Global cooling from 1940 to the 1970s, and warming from the 1970s to 2008, coincided with fluctuations in ocean currents and cloud cover driven by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) - a naturally occurring rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. 123 According to a 2014 article by Don Easterbrook, PhD, Professor Emeritus of Geology at Western Washington University, the \"PDO cool mode has replaced the warm mode in the Pacific Ocean, virtually assuring us of about 30 years of global cooling, perhaps much deeper than the global cooling from about 1945 to 1977.\" 88 Read More", "Increased hurricane activity and other extreme weather events are a result of natural weather patterns, not human-caused climate change.\nAccording to a 2013 report from the Tropical Meteorology Project at Colorado State University, the increase in human-produced CO2 over the past century has had \"little or no significant effect\" on global tropical cyclone activity. The report further states that specific hurricanes, including Sandy, Ivan, Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and Ike, were not a direct consequence of human-caused global warming. 89 Between 1995-2015 increased hurricane activity (including Katrina) was recorded, however, according to the NOAA, it was not the result of human-induced climate change; it was the result of cyclical tropical cyclone patterns, driven primarily by natural ocean currents. 125 Many types of recorded extreme weather events over the past half-century have actually become less frequent and less severe. 93 Professor of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Judith Curry, PhD, states that she is \"unconvinced by any of the arguments that I have seen that attributes a single extreme weather event, a cluster of extreme weather events, or statistics of extreme weather events\" to human-caused climate change. 90 Richard Lindzen, PhD, Emeritus Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also states that there is a lack of evidence connecting extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, or floods, to human-caused global warming. 92 Read More"]}
