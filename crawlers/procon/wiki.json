Such crimes are known as capital crimes, and tend to be grave crimes against persons or governments (such as premeditated murder, rape or treason).  For many years, English law imposed capital punishment for the crime of polygamy. The basis for capital punishment comes from the Bible, particularly passages such as Genesis 9:5\u20136, though critics of biblical Christianity falsely accuse Christians of hypocrisy for holding to the biblical position.", "There are several compelling justifications for the death penalty today.  It promotes conversion and confession by the criminal.  It can bring closure and relief to the families of victims of terrible crimes.  It can deter wrongdoing.  It can be a helpful negotiating tool for prosecutors to obtain a prompt confession and life sentence rather than force victims' families to endure delays in justice, and a disturbing trial.  The death penalty also helps ensure that the criminal does not repeat his crime in prison, or escape and harm the public further.", "Opposition to the death penalty ignores its foregoing justifications, and instead resorts to pacifist arguments.  Most opponents of the death penalty are inconsistently pro-abortion.  The Roman Catholic Church supported the death penalty for most of its existence, but has changed its doctrine in 2018. Pope Francis argued that capital punishment is unacceptable in all cases.  Jesus never denounced the death penalty despite clear opportunities to do so.", "Although support for the death penalty has largely been Christian and conservative-based, with most of the opposition coming from the left, there's at least one case where the death penalty was supported by leftist people, although only if its use is due to \"political crimes\" rather than the listed crimes above, as Jean Paul Sartre when asked about this bluntly answered with the following: \"Yes. In a revolutionary country in which the bourgeoisie has been swept from power, the bourgeois who would foment a riot or a plot would deserve the death penalty\u2026A revolutionary regime must get rid of a certain number of individuals that threaten it and I see no other means for this than death; it is always possible to get out of a prison; the revolutionaries of 1793 probably didn't kill enough people.\"", "Contents", "1 In the world today", "1.1 Australia", "1.2 United States", "1.2.1 Methods in the United States", "1.2.2 History", "1.3 France", "1.4 Canada", "1.5 Saudi Arabia", "1.6 European Union", "1.7 North Korea", "2 Morality", "3 Religious views of capital punishment", "3.1 Christianity", "3.1.1 Biblical View", "3.1.2 Roman Catholicism", "3.1.3 Mainline Christianity", "3.1.4 Conservative Christianity", "3.1.5 Unification Church", "4 Theism, atheism and the death penalty", "5 Injustices Caused by Limits on Death Penalty", "6 See also", "7 Further reading", "8 References", "9 External links", "In the world today", "Of the main developed countries, only the United States, Belarus and Japan use formalized capital punishment, though many developed countries give law enforcement greater authority to kill than allowed by the United States.

It has been calculated that each person executed saves the lives of anywhere from 3 to 18 innocent people. Other studies have shown that as a whole, \"death-penalty states\" typically have higher murder rates than states that do not have capital punishment, but obviously many other factors influence the overall murder rate, such as poverty and policies toward repeat offenders.", "Methods in the United States", "Lethal injection is the official method of capital punishment in almost all of the 38 states that have the death penalty. A few states allow for other methods in some circumstances. Several botched electrocutions in Florida in the 1990s have effectively put an end to the era of the electric chair, which was the most common means of execution in the United States before 1972. In addition to these two methods of execution, lethal gas, hanging, and shooting have all been used at least twice since 1977. Firing squads were conducted in Utah, most recently in 2010. The three hangings took place in Washington and Delaware, most recently Billy Bailey's 1996 hanging in Delaware. The gas chamber, which has been abandoned because it has been found to normally lead to slow death, has been used in California, Arizona, Nevada, Mississippi, and North Carolina since 1977. Walter LeGrand's 1999 execution in Arizona's gas chamber will almost certainly be the last of this type.", "History", "In American history, there was regional variation in the use of the death penalty (with The South always higher), the execution rate (per million people) dropped steadily between the colonial period and the present, that the number of crimes meriting the death penalty was sharply reduced, and few women were executed, while a disproportionate number of African American, ethnic, and poor men died at the hands of the state.   In Colonial America, capital punishment was used more frequently, as it fit into the context of colonial life. Rates of execution were similar to those in England and matched the general violence of colonial life. There were no prisons for long-term incarceration (only jails for brief incarcerations.) Public executions served as communal warnings. By the 1790s, executions began to decline. Many capital offenses were dropped, the methods of execution changed, and long-term incarceration in prison emerged as the preferred alternative punishment. Executions disappeared from the public square except in the cases of lynchings, which grew in numbers in the South after the Civil War.", "France", "The United States has never used the guillotine, which was very popular in France. The last use of the guillotine in France was in 1977. Thereafter, capital punishment in France was abolished, in 1981.", "Canada", "Canada does not employ capital punishment, and it has not been a possible sentence in Canadian civilian courts since 1976.", "Canada long employed capital punishment as a punishment for murder or treason, typically executing prisoners by long drop hanging in the case of civilians, and by firing squad in the case of soldiers or other military. (In particular, 25 soldiers were executed for various crimes during World War I.) Canada had several notorious executioners, particularly Arthur B. English, also known as \"Arthur Ellis\", after whom the Arthur Ellis Awards \u2013 a Canadian literary award \u2013 for mystery writing is named.", "While Canada's use of capital punishment was inherited from the legal system of the United Kingdom, opposition to capital punishment began to arise in the late 1950s, and came to a head in 1959, when Steven Truscott, a 14-year-old boy, was convicted of murder, with a recommendation from the jury for mercy. The judge passed down a sentence of execution by hanging, then the only legal punishment for murder in Canada.", "While Truscott's death sentence would later be commuted in 1960, his case galvanized public opinion, and in 1961 Canada reclassified capital murder, defining it as a murder that involved premeditation, murder during the commission of a violent crime, or the murder of a police officer or prison guard. This marked the beginning of the decline of capital punishment in Canada, as the last executions would be in December, 1962. The government of Canada routinely commuted any death sentence passed thereafter (indeed, the Liberal Party made opposition to capital punishment a part of their platform).", "In 1976, this de facto state of affairs became law, when the Canadian Parliament abolished the use of capital punishment under the Criminal Code. Executions were still permitted under the National Defense Act until 1998, when they were similarly abolished.", "Currently, Canada's Supreme Court does not allow the extradition of criminals who may be executed for their crimes.", "Saudi Arabia", "Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam under which those convicted of murder, drug trafficking, rape and armed robbery are executed in public with a sword. As of November 25, 2007, Saudi Arabia has beheaded 136 people, 38 people in 2006 and 83 people in 2005.", "European Union", "The death penalty has been abolished in all 28 European Union member states, and 47 out of the 50 countries in Europe (only Belarus still practices it, and Russia has had an effective moratorium since 1996). The EU has long been against capital punishment, and campaigns for its abolition worldwide, but the Treaty of Lisbon introduced capital punishment for \"mutiny\" EU-wide. Ironically, abolition of capital punishment is anyway a condition of acceding to the EU and EU law also bans detainee transfers in cases where the receiving party may seek the death penalty.", "North Korea", "The Associated Press has reported that executions and torture in North Korea are \"worse than animal slaughter.\" \"One inmate, Choe Kwang Ho, sneaked away from his work for 15 minutes to pick fruit. He was executed, his mouth stuffed with gravel to prevent him from protesting.\" \"If a female inmate got pregnant, he said, she and her lover would be shot to death publicly. Then, An said, prison guards would cut open her womb, remove the fetus and bury it or feed it to guard dogs.\"", "Morality", "Some have questioned how a nation such as the United States that largely identifies itself as Christian (76.5%) could have 65% of Americans believing putting someone to death for a crime is acceptable. They question whether or not the Bible allows such a view.  The 6th Commandment is wrongly translated by liberals as, \"Thou shalt not kill.\"  This translation suggests that executions are a sin. The correct translation of the 6th Commandment is \"Thou shalt commit no murder.\"  As murder is defined as \"wrongful killing\", when following that translation it is possible to argue whether or not judicial executions are murder. In any case, any possible moral justification for humans to met out capital punishment upon other humans is based on exactly two interacting facts: 1) humans in the fallen world already are subject to eventual death by natural means; 2) some offenses (crimes, sins) are biologically so deep that the integrity of the central victim(s) is too compromised to recover by natural means (including, but not limited to, death). Added to those two facts is a third: the maintenance of such offenders is in no way the duty of the offended, so long as the offended is not already so guilty ('let only those who are without hypocrisy cast the first stone', or 'a family of thieves cannot selectively punish its members'.)  Finally, and most importantly, the 6th Commandment is part of the Mosaic Law in the Old Testament, which mandates capital punishment for many offenses (see below); therefore, an interpretation of the 6th Commandment as forbidding capital punishment is nonsensical.", "Religious views of capital punishment", "Christianity", "Biblical View", "The Bible has several passages support the death penalty for different offenses.

However, apart from the controversy regarding the canonical status of the passage, it is argued that Jesus is shown to be upholding the law, while only stopping the execution of the women by hypocrites, who were themselves convicted of such sins, similar to or including adultery. (cf. Matthew 7:5; Romans 2:1) Other Christians argue that the unjust execution of Jesus demonstrates that capital punishment is immoral, though Jesus is not seen opposing the legitimacy of capital punishment itself, and only the unjust use of such power.

Hardon, S.J., which was given the \"imprimatur\" (official endorsement) by Joseph T.

Christian dispensation made no essential change [to the Old Testament endorsement of the death penalty], as St. Paul expressly says .... [citing Romans 13:4].  Among the errors of the Waldenses condemned by the Church in the early thirteenth century was the proposition that denied the lawfulness of capital punishment (Argentre, Collectio de Novis Erroribus, I, 86).  St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-74) defends capital punishment on the grounds of the common good. ...  If even with capital punishment crime abounds, no lesser penalty will suffice.  The practice question remains of how effective a deterrent capital punishment is in some modern states, when rarely used or only after long delays.  In principle, however, it is morally licit because in the most serious crimes the claims of retribution and deterrence are so demanding that the corrective value of punishment must, if necessary, be sacrificed.", "The current official Catholic teaching, as stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, reads as follows:", "If, instead, bloodless means are sufficient to defend against the aggressor and to protect the safety of persons, public authority should limit itself to such means, because they better correspond to the concrete conditions of the common good and are more in conformity to the dignity of the human person. ", "Today, in fact, given the means at the State's disposal to effectively repress crime by rendering inoffensive the one who has committed it, without depriving him definitively of the possibility of redeeming himself, cases of absolute necessity for suppression of the offender \"today ... are very rare, if not practically non-existent.\"", "Other Catholic officials have gone further. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops has \"called for an end to the use of the death penalty for more than twenty-five years.\"", "This surprising new position is at odds with the historic use by the Church of capital punishment to deal with heretics, and the cremation of the exhumed bodies of heretics.

One arbitrary prohibition established by the U.S. Supreme Court on use of the death penalty is when the murder is committed by someone under the age of 18.  Prior to this Supreme Court ruling, states had statutory minimum ages (at the time of crime) for when the death penalty could be imposed.  Other prohibitions have eliminated it for crimes other than murder, for those who are incapable of understanding why they are to be executed, and requiring a unanimous jury verdict.", "The award-winning documentary The Thin Blue Line portrays the true story of the framing of an innocent drifter because the age of the real murderer was slightly below the legal minimum for imposing the death penalty.  The crime was the heinous murder of a police officer during a routine traffic stop, and the outrage at the crime cried out for retribution with the death penalty.  But the authorities were legally barred from executing the real murderer, and an adult drifter who was in the wrong place at the wrong time was convicted for it.  He served years on death row before being released after the movie was widely seen: he could easily have been killed for a crime he didn't commit. Some would use this as an argument against the death penalty, as mistakes like this are sometimes made in court, but the death penalty ensures that when they happen, their effect is permanent."]},

That states with the death penalty have higher murder rates than states without does not necessarily mean that there is a causal relationship between murder rates and capital punishment. The April 18, 2012 report by the National Research Council of the National Academies reviewed more than three decades of research and concluded that studies claiming a deterrent effect on murder rates from the death penalty are fundamentally flawed. Criminologist Daniel Nagin of Carnegie Mellon said: \"Nothing is known about how potential murderers actually perceive their risk of punishment.\" The report concluded: \u201cThe committee concludes that research to date on the effect of capital punishment on homicide is not informative about whether capital punishment decreases, increases, or has no effect on homicide rates\".", "Racism", "Racism is a factor in determining who gets executed.

Since you're the nigger, you're elected.\" Brandley was exonerated in 1990 after ten years on death row.", "Judges are also known to drop an occasional N-bomb when the accused's life is at stake.  In preparing for the penalty phase of an African-American defendant's trial, a white judge in Florida said in open court: \"Since the nigger mom and dad are here anyway, why don't we go ahead and do the penalty phase today instead of having to subpoena them back at cost to the state.\" Anthony Peek was sentenced to death and the sentence was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court in 1986 reviewing his claim of racial bias. Juries can also engage in racist language. One black member of the jury (that convicted a black man) later described an atmosphere of racial intimidation.

(So off with their heads, eh?) In fact, the death penalty actually costs more in the US due to increased investigative expenses, appeals (paid for by taxpayers), and the cost of the execution itself. There are also arguments that bring up the diminishing space in jails, but they fail to consider that people about to be executed are placed on death row (usually for several years at least in the US) and need to be supported.", "There is also a psychological cost for the death penalty for most people involved, one of the less documented consequences of the death penalty, as most of the procedure is done in secrecy and most executioners are anonymous. Many workers involved in executions, in their efforts to treat death row inmates with decency, have reported suffering post traumatic stress disorder or similar symptoms, including flashbacks and nightmares, and they have entered bouts of deep reflection after the execution. Most do experience painful feelings and cope through suppression, but others with disassociative methods suffer from stress, guilt, and depression. In an interview with Jerry Givens, who worked 17 years executing 62 people, Givens stated that his work with execution has made him change his views from supporting the death penalty to opposing it, and he had to deal with a lot of moral disengagement, which took a toll on his psyche.

Wallace Conners, who knew Griffin and was an eyewitness to the shooting, said Griffin was not there, but Conners was not called to give evidence. Griffin died by lethal injection in 1995. In Georgia, Troy Davis was executed although there was inconsistency in the evidence of different prosecution witnesses. Most non-police witnesses contradicted or recanted their evidence and said they gave evidence under police pressure. One of the few who did not recant was implicated as the shooter by other witnesses In Texas, Carlos DeLuna was executed for the brutal murder of a woman.  The real murderer was almost certainly a different man, Carlos Hernandez, though prosecutors maintained Hernandez was a figment of DeLuna's imagination.  After the execution investigators tracked Hernandez down, and he had a police record including violence against women and the suspected murder of another woman, so police should have been able to find him. Also in Texas, Claude Jones was convicted of capital murder based on evidence from an accomplice and a strand of hair.  The accomplice later stated his evidence in court was untrue and had been given to get himself a reduced sentence.  Then-governor George W. Bush refused to delay the execution to test the DNA of the hair and Jones was executed. Subsequent testing proved the hair was from the victim and not Jones. Yet another Texas case involved Cameron Todd Willingham whose three daughters died in a fire. The prosecution maintained the fire was an arson he started, while fire experts have stated that the forensic evidence was seriously flawed. This forensic evidence was questioned while Willingham was still alive, but the execution went ahead nevertheless, presided by Rick Perry (the man behind 278 executions). In 1992, Johnny Garrett was executed for the murder of a nun Sister Taeda Benz. 12 years later a man named Lencio Rueda was implicated in the murder of a woman named Narnie Bryson, who had died in almost identical circumstances to Sister Benz and when pressed by Garrett's lawyer admitted that the bloody shirt found at the scene of Sister Benz's murder belonged to him.

Rather, the argument may point instead to a more basic difficulty, namely the difficulty of reconciling the imposition of the death penalty as currently administered with procedures necessary to assure that the wrong person is not executed.  (Justice Breyer in a dissenting opinion over the execution of Manuel Valle who was on death row for 33 years)", "Condemned prisoners in the United States typically spend 10 years or more in solitary confinement on death row, but a few prisoners have spent over 30 years there.

For 10 years before Hinton's release experts maintained the guns Hinton was accused of using did not match evidence in the murders he was convicted of.", "Prisoners are isolated for 23 hours a day in small cells (8 by 10 feet is a typical size), and the majority of death row prisoners have hard beds without mattresses. Prisoners' chances to get social contact, exercise, employment and education are severely limited. For some the combination of isolation and uncertainty causes serious mental deterioration. Some prisoners decide they would rather die than face longer time on death row.", "Prosecutors and judges are more often than not elected and want to show voters they are tough on crime, while defense lawyers are frequently underpaid and lack resources to work effectively. Only people who agree with capital punishment may serve on capital juries, therefore many death sentences are passed.  Between 1973 and 1995 5% of death sentences led to execution, while 68% were later reversed. Courts later decide two thirds of prisoners experiencing the agony of death row should not be there.", "Delay in the Commonwealth", "The 1993 Privy Council case of Pratt v AG of Jamaica highlighted the psychological suffering that is experienced by guilty prisoners and also by those later exonerated while they are on death row. The defendants had been convicted of murder in 1979, and had spent over 10 years on death row waiting for their execution whilst the underfunded and overstretched Jamaican legal system reviewed their appeals. At the time, 23 prisoners on death row had been awaiting execution for more than 10 years and 82 prisoners had been awaiting execution for more than five years. On three separate occasions, death warrants were read to them and they were removed to a holding cell and prepared for their hanging, only to be saved at the last minute by lawyers. Lord Griffiths is a Law Lord who got his position in the House of Lords through his legal ability and is not a hereditary peer. Griffiths, in a masterful piece of legal writing, observed that: ", "\u201c\u201dThere is an instinctive revulsion against the prospect of hanging a man after he has been held under sentence of death for many years.  ... we regard it as an inhuman act to keep a man facing the agony of execution over a long extended period of time ... A state that wishes to retain capital punishment must accept the responsibility of ensuring that execution follows as swiftly as practicable after sentence, allowing a reasonable time for appeal and consideration of reprieve. It is part of the human condition that a condemned man will take every opportunity to save his life through use of the appellate procedure.  If the appellate procedure enables the prisoner to prolong the appellate hearings over a period of years, the fault is to be attributed to the appellate system that permits such delay and not to the prisoner who takes advantage of it.", "The Privy Council concluded by holding that spending more than five years on death row constituted \"inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment,\" which is prohibited in pretty much every human rights treaty.

Euthanasia can be a form of homicide when another person carries it out. Theorists usually distinguish between voluntary (with the person's consent) involuntary (without their consent) and non-voluntary (when the person is unable to consent, such as a comatose patient) forms of euthanasia. Generally only voluntary and non-voluntary forms of euthanasia are legal.

Those against euthanasia prefer to talk about the \"sanctity of life\" and the spirit of fighting through \"bad times.\" At the same time, they in turn invoke \"dignity\" to argue that euthanasia diminishes this. Sufferers of chronic conditions often resent the implication that they cannot live meaningful lives with dignity, while people speaking of how \"sacred\" life is aren't in general bedridden or permanently drugged up with pain-killers, so they're also not in the best position to speak on the subject.

Numerous websites and books contain the recipes and methods needed to invoke a painless and more dignified death than more \"conventional\" suicide mechanisms.", "Passive euthanasia is deliberately leaving a patient without medical care so that they will die due to their condition at an earlier stage. This is common with terminal illnesses, such as cancer, where the quality of life is reduced throughout treatment. Sometimes it is the express wish of the individual not to be treated or not to be revived in the case of cardiac arrest.", "The \"passive\" option can further be divided into what is known as \"non-active\" euthanasia. In this case, although death is intentional and undoubtedly caused by the action, it is indirect or technically a side effect of the action. End-of-life hospice care often involves such acts as administering pain killers at a level that will relieve intense pain and may also hasten death \u2013 a process sometimes referred to as the \"principle of double effect\" where the patient's death is not the desired outcome of the action, but is recognised as a side effect of the treatment. Non-active euthanasia can also include switching off life support machines or removing feeding tubes, such as in the case of Terri Schiavo. There is much debate in the moral philosophy community over whether there is any real philosophical difference between \"active\" and \"passive\" forms of euthanasia.

With the minimum age at which a foetus can survive outside its mother being pushed back further and further, in some cases past cut-off dates for abortion, such groups thus argue that foetuses are being aborted that could survive on their own (albeit with medical help) \u2014 to abort them, therefore, is murder, as mentioned above, and is Biblically prohibited. There is also a tenuous argument for distinct personhood before birth in Jeremiah\u00a01:5 which states that, \"before I formed you in the womb I chose you\"; this is commonly interpreted by pro-life groups as implying separate existence before birth, but, given the context, it is just as likely to refer to divine foreknowledge. (Though wouldn't \"before I formed you\" imply personhood before conception?)", "An argument has developed, on the other hand, that the Bible attaches less 'personhood' to foetuses and very young children. Exodus\u00a021:22, a mere ten verses after the above injunction against murder, states that, if a man hits a woman, causing a miscarriage or premature birth, but no serious injury, he should be subject to a court-mediated fine from the woman's husband. If this was the case, then the act of causing a miscarriage could not be construed as 'murder' (since compensation was not biblically allowed for murder). This, while relying on a fair amount of extrapolation beyond the text itself, would seem to justify abortion, as it does not involve the taking of a human life. Furthermore, Numbers\u00a05:11-31 seems to outline a priest-administered test for unfaithfulness, by administering an abortifacient, 'bitter water', that would show if a woman had conceived (presumably out of wedlock).", "There is also some precedent for divinely caused abortions: Hosea\u00a09:11-16 (in which Hosea prays for God to cause Ephraim's women to miscarry).

Firearms dealers must obtain licenses, and all sales through such dealers are subject to a criminal-background check. Private person-to-person transactions are exempt from the federal background-check requirement, but some states require background checks for all sales, including private sales. Online sales by private individuals are also allowed, but the seller must send the gun to a licensed dealer, who will complete the transfer to the buyer (including doing the required background check).

Moreso, even with the Second Amendment, it is reasonable that this right carries limtations, as even rights people agree on, such as free speech and freedom of religious expression, also carry limitations.

This includes deaths from family conflicts, suicide, thieves stealing the gun, children mishandling the gun, ricocheting bullets, misfiring, and police confrontations. This is further exacerbated by racial profiling, as black Americans with guns are far more likely to get shot. A gun additionally gives its owner a false sense of security as well as an exaggerated sensitivity to threats, letting the owner take risks he or she otherwise will not take. For instance, in Florida, in a physical confrontation over parking, the man who was knocked down overreacted to the threat and fatally shot the man who shoved him.

For instance, Glenn Beck has compared net neutrality proponents to Marxists, which is hilarious because by that \"logic\" the entirety of Silicon Valley would be Marxists.

However, with ISPs threatening to sue, the battle is not yet over. Nevertheless, for now the fight appears to be swinging in favor of the average consumer. Nope.

Houses, offices and businesses are connected to one another by a network of roads and streets.  To be able to reach other locations in the city, you need to pay a small monthly fee for a company to add you to their road network and maintain the network.  There's a few companies which own the road network, competing with one another to provide better, cheaper service.  ", "Let's say one of these companies \u2013 let's call them Horizon \u2013 happens to own the only road which leads to the office of a really popular business called Gaggle Inc.  That stretch of road gets a lot of traffic.  Gaggle already pays for a ton of lanes to reach their office so that they can get customers in and out quickly.  But Horizon sees an opportunity and turns this stretch of road into a toll lane, charging customers coming in for using that route.  They can also choose to redirect customers who are trying to reach Gaggle to a competing business, like Ding, provided there's a financial incentive.", "Another company \u2013 we'll call them Camcost \u2013 notices that they're losing clients to 80 and Tea, a competing company which offers a similar service for much less per month.  Camcost decides this is unacceptable and so they cut down on the lanes leading to the 80 and Tea road network until there's only one route with one lane.  While people using 80 and Tea's service notice no difference, people using Camcost's service notice it takes significantly longer to reach 80 and Tea's office and are thus discouraged from switching companies.", "In perhaps the most disturbing application of this analogy, 80 and Tea has two clients.  One is a major political candidate and the other is a journalist working out a small office.  The journalist doesn't have a lot of traffic.  But one day, 80 and Tea gets a call from their candidate who tells them that this journalist is about to write a story they don't want seen.  The candidate can't order the story to be suppressed \u2013 that would be a violation of the First Amendment \u2013 but they can pay 80 and Tea to ensure the journalist's story can't be read.  So 80 and Tea blocks all traffic to and from the journalist's office indefinitely.  ", "Obviously the Internet is not a big city and packets are not cars.  But this serves to illustrate what ISPs are capable of doing without net neutrality.", "All packets are created equal", "What net neutrality dictates is that all Internet traffic, regardless of source or destination, is to be treated equally.  This means that Internet service providers cannot discriminate between packets sent from a competing ISP, or charge more for traffic to or from a specific source or destination, or block sites based on their content (an exception exists for illegal content).  They can, of course, charge their customers for a bigger \"pipe\" (Google, for instance, has a massive link to a Tier 1 ISP) which equates to a better incoming/outgoing traffic capacity, but they cannot charge Google merely for connecting to a certain number of customers per day or for sending a certain volume of traffic through that pipe per month.", "In relation to the Fairness Doctrine, net neutrality has no similarities.  The Fairness Doctrine was a purely political framework dictating that a radio or television station promoting one viewpoint had to give equal time to the opposite viewpoint.  So, if you were to host El Rushbo on your radio station for an hour, the next hour would have to feature a guaranteed timeslot for a liberal speaker.  This was why pundits like Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly were almost unheard of before the 1990s, when the Fairness Doctrine was lifted \u2013 every hour hosting one political commentator required an extra hour hosting a second political commentator.  ", "However, net neutrality opponents (ironically a lot of libertarians) argue that both net neutrality and the Fairness Doctrine are examples of the government's overreach into the free market, and the fact that the Fairness Doctrine failed should be seen as a reason to burn net neutrality.  In reality, net neutrality isn't as simple as regulation versus deregulation; net neutrality ensures that Internet service providers cannot act as regulators themselves, in effect decentralizing the Internet by buffering their power against consumers and Internet companies. With or without net neutrality, the Internet will be regulated, but net neutrality ensures that the power to regulate is itself heavily regulated (to the point that it is de facto deregulation).

This article draws from a comprehensive review of Obamacare the President requested from his staff in 2015. A random survey conducted in 2009 by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York found that 63% of doctors support giving patients a choice between public and private insurance, 10% favor the public option only, and 27% private insurance only. Therefore, almost three quarters of medical practitioners support the public option.

Low-income individuals would be exempt from co-pays and deductibles. Employers may maintain their own insurance plans and employees may choose between government insurance or what their employers provide. Employer-provided health insurance would largely be tax-free.

While private insurance is presently part of Medicare, that would no longer the case under Medicare for All; nor would there be co-pays and deductibles. Medicare for All is a single-payer universal healthcare system. In order to fund his generous welfare program, Sanders proposed a payroll tax on employers and various new taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations.", "Support for Medicare for All appears to be growing.

Specifically, 59% support Sanders' Medicare-for-all proposal and 75% favor a public option or expansion of Medicare. Another conducted by Reuters in June and July 2018 shows that a vast majority of Americans, 70%, now support single-payer healthcare. Medical service providers are also warming to the idea. Even though their payments may fall in the long-run, administrative costs and the amounts of paperwork will also decrease. What really matters to them is not reimbursement rates but net income.

There's no clear consensus on this, and there is obviously a difference between an occasional light smack and beating a child on a regular basis. Proponents have also used the argument that they were hit as a child, yet \"turned out fine\", a rather fallacious argument. A child being disciplined by corporal punishment may grow up believing that it is the right of a parent to be able to hit their children. The context in which the punishment takes place is also important, since the parent's punishment may be more influenced by their own emotional state rather than a rational determination of the action necessary to correct the behaviour of a child. It's a bit like allowing a judge to preside over a court case (and act as the jury) in which the defendant is on trial for punching the judge shortly before the trial began.

There are two main reasons the scientific evidence behind the risks of cannabis can seem so contradictory: first, prohibition makes studying cannabis's effects tricky for researchers, and second, media often reports studies that have major implications, but not the many subsequent studies that undermine them.

On the one hand, most feminists accept that when a woman is able to be in control of choices, it is her right to use her own body as she wishes, as long as the sex is safe, consensual and fair.  This view is especially true of so called \"sex positive\" feminists.  On the other hand, prostitution is generally regarded as never safe, consensual and fair, causing many feminists to see it as exploitative.  Extreme feminists have argued that in most societies and relationships, prostitution is the norm, though it might be \"sex for a zirconium carbon diamond ring\".  In this view, any prostitution reinforces the view of female as property to be bought and sold (meaning this view conveniently ignores male prostitutes).", "Radical feminist objections to sex work also often align with older, religiously-based objections.

Summarizing those studies is a daunting task, but two recent meta-studies analyzing the research conducted since the early 1990s concludes that the minimum wage has little or no discernible effect on the employment prospects of low-wage workers.  The most likely reason for this outcome is that the cost shock of the minimum wage is small relative to most firms' overall costs and only modest relative to the wages paid to low-wage workers. In the traditional discussion of the minimum wage, economists have focused on how these costs affect employment outcomes, but employers have many other channels of adjustment.\"", "A 2013  U.C.

However, the Luca's survey did not actually attempt to study the overall impact of the minimum wage increases on unemployment, and the author of the study Micheal Luca himself hypothesizes that the failure of some restaurants may increase sales in remaining restaurants, causing more people to become employed to meet increased demand at these remaining restaurants. This could offset the unemployment caused by the worse restaurants failing, though Luca says more research needs to be done on this particular impact. . This brings up another valid point on the minimum wage. If you as an employer aren't paying your employees enough money to live on, and your business is still on pins and needles or is getting poor reviews, maybe there's something wrong with your own business model. Sure, the minimum wage increases costs to businesses, and they have to deal with those increased costs, but there are other reasons why a business could be failing. For example, a business could have low sales because they exist in an oversaturated market, or a poor location with low traffic, or they might not be investing enough into advertising, or they might not have the niche market they once had anymore as competition has introduced products that compete with theirs, or maybe their food's quality needs to be improved. On the cost side, they could be facing high rent costs, high food costs, or high franchisee costs if they're a franchisee. There are any number of reasons as to why a business is failing that might have nothing to do with the cost of labor. Again, yes, the government does have SOME impact on the costs of doing business such as food safety standards and minimum wages, among other things, but business owners have to take SOME responsibility for running a bad business, that's all.", "Price/wage spiral", "One argument against minimum wage is that businesses will try to keep profit margins fixed, and attempt to raise prices to transfer the cost increases to the consumer.  Since the workers are (some of) the consumers, at some point the minimum wage will be raised to match the increased cost of living.  Then the prices of products and services will again be raised to preserve the profit margins, producing a vicious cycle. ", "In reality, this doesn't always occur because there is a limit on the ability for the business to raise prices, mostly due to competition from places that have a different minimum wage level.  Also since training a person to any job costs money reducing turnover is another option other than the standard cut hours/jobs or raise prices argument generally presented.   In fact, a University of Washington survey seemed to prove that prices don't rise in tandem with a wage increase.  ", "Another flaw in this argument is the fact that both corporate profits and CEO salaries have increased to insane levels.  \"In the 1950s, a typical CEO made 20 times the salary of his or her average worker.

No matter how you slice it is obvious that not only have wages not kept with inflation but the money the companies made is going into the CEO pockets rather then the workers.", "Note these are averages; the individual percentages of CEO to the average worker for specific companies is even more insane. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) passed new rules that all public companies will be required to disclose the ratio of CEO pay to median worker pay beginning in 2017 giving a better insight to just what that ratio is.", "Another issue is when you compare what is supposed to be the exact same good around the world this claim doesn't hold up either.

Video game consoles come in models intended to be used at home, like Microsoft's Xbox One, Sony's PlayStation 4, and Nintendo's Switch, or handheld systems that can be played anywhere (as long as the battery isn't dead; fortunately today's handheld systems come with internal rechargeable batteries so they don't eat up AAs like older systems), such as Nintendo's 3DS and Switch (again), along with Sony's PlayStation Vita.", "The first \"real\" video game, a tennis game created in 1958, used a dedicated analog computer as a control system and an oscilloscope for output.", "Contents", "1 Moral panics", "1.1 Moral guardians", "1.2 Sex", "1.3 Fanboys", "2 Impact on attitudes", "2.1 Violence", "2.2 Sexism", "2.2.1 Riot Games lawsuit", "2.3 Racism", "3 Health issues", "3.1 Warnings", "3.2 Brain development", "3.3 Addiction", "4 Societal issues", "4.1 Gambling", "5 See also", "6 Games with articles", "7 External links", "8 Notes", "9 References", "Moral panics", "See the main article on this topic: Moral panic", "  Ahhh, the good old days!", "Like most new technologies, video games have spent the last thirty years being accused of corrupting the youth, joining comic books, television, radio, recorded music, role playing games and comprehensive sex education on a dubious list of moral panics created by people who forgot or maybe never knew what it was like to be a kid.", "Making the issue worse, moral guardians (such as the infamous ex-attorney Jack Thompson) take the \"kid stuff\" concept to ridiculous extremes, failing to distinguish between games marketed to children and games marketed to adults, and making hysterical judgements on the effects of video games on players.", "The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has a very, very long list of advisories \u2014 while most deal with sex and violence content, there are applications such as electronic cookbooks that include advisories for \"alcohol references\" and a few other similar sillies.

In English-speaking countries, Australia has banned several games, and at one point Greece tried to outlaw all public video gaming in a massive overreaction to a political gambling scandal.

Game developers and modders do things such as creating nude skins for female characters, or creating explicitly sexual third-party content, or even creating games like the highly controversial RapeLay, a literal rape simulator written and subsequently banned in Japan. Sex in video games has therefore long been a subject of both controversy and amusement. The game Mass Effect, despite being rated M (17+) by the ESRB, caused a moral panic in the conservative media because of one mild alien sex scene that would be just fine on an evening network television show; this culminated in a Fox News shitfest where feminist undertones were used to criticize it.", "Fanboys", "Fanboys, as extremely dedicated gamers of a particular console, game series, or genre are derogatorily called, frequently have their own moral mishaps that sometimes even make it into the media. For example, in Novermber 17, 2006, Jeff Gerstmann received death threats after awarding the high-fantasy game Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess an 8.8 out of 10 (\"Great\"), which apparently wasn't enough for fans of the series. Given that nearly none of the fanboys knew that any review is biased, an angry tirade of fanboys messaged threats to the reviewer, and a lockdown to the Gamespot building ensued, meaning that nobody in the building got in or got out due to fears of being lynched in the street over an opinion. Gerstmann vowed never to review a Zelda game again.", "However, if that wasn't enough fanboyism for a gaming website, Gamespot in December 19, 2013 made the same unapparent mistake of reviewing a Legend of Zelda game, this time done by reviewer Martin Gaston. Again, the building went on lockdown for Gatson nominating the game A Link Between Worlds for the Nintendo 3DS Game of the Year, which, for batshit fanatics, was too much for a Zelda game given that it broke the formula of a top-view Zelda game which hadn't been used in a while.

In the transition between the third and fourth generations of video games this was the case in the Console Wars with the famous consoles Sega Genesis and Nintendo NES (later it was the SNES, triggering what was called the Bit Wars so called for who got from 16 to 32 to 64 bits of technology, ad infinitum, ad nauseaum), but in the latest years due to Sega having left the console market in 2001 and Nintendo having a truly narrow demographic it has switched to that of the Sony Playstation 4 and the Microsoft Xbox One. Vicious attacks on both sides have ensued, but near its release the Xbox One had the greatest controversy due to its supposed invasion of privacy, which requires an online connection every 24 hours, and as a result of the controversy Microsoft dropped its plans for DRM shortly before launch. Along for the ride are PC fanboys who detest consoles in general, and many refer to themselves as the \"PC master race\" and to the console players as \"console peasants\".", "Impact on attitudes", "\u201c\u201dIf Pacman had affected us as kids we'd be running around in dark rooms, munching pills and listening to repetitive music.", " \u2014Marcus Brigstocke", "Video games have mixed impacts on players' attitudes towards violence, sexism, and racism.", "Violence", "During the first surge of video game popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a somewhat widespread belief that the use of multiple lives in a video game could lead players to not value their own lives (very much in the same spirit as the idea that video game players were allegedly detached enough that they wouldn't understand violence was wrong).", "There's no getting around one point \u2014 many video games are violent. Some violent games such as Mortal Kombat and God of War are very successful. The latter was particularly notorious in the early 2000s for offending various parenting sensibilities (it had, among other things, blood and gore, intense violence, strong language, monster-hacking, and general nudey themes) and the former effectively set off the entire panic itself. Games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Max Payne transpose graphic violence into gangster and police procedural settings, and first-person shooters (a genre dating to the 1980 arcade game Battlezone) gained a reputation from their 1990s flagbearer Doom for immense amounts of gratuitous and often supernatural violence.", "Needless to say, like any other new media panic, the old media loves to feast on these things \u2014 one of the Columbine shooters, for example, was a modestly talented Doom level designer, so many people blamed their gaming rather than their social isolation or fascist political leanings for the slaughter. Pop psychologist \"Dr.\" Phil McGraw has been known to do shows on the alleged danger of video games, as have police procedurals such as Criminal Minds and the Law and Order franchise. In the United States, the Entertainment Software Rating Board was organized to provide MPAA-like content ratings for video games, with this system also being used in Canada while Japan, Europe, and Australia have their own rating systems; however, the perception (by and large a post hoc ergo propter hoc confusing of causality and correlation) continues that excessive video game violence can cause bad behavior in youth, presumably on the assumption that video gamers have a somewhat tenuous grasp of reality. The fact that this has been said about role playing games, comics, and (in a recent case) horror novels without being borne out by studies on the subject really doesn't faze anyone involved in the moral outrage industry.", "However, there is psychological research that validates concerns regarding violent video games and an increase in aggressive behavior in children. The American Psychological Association has found that children playing video games in a general category do not show an increase in violent or aggressive behavior. They did find that children who played violent titles saw an increase in aggressive behavior. The APA has called on the industry to design video games that include increased parental control over the amount of violence the games contain.", "In the wake of the 2018 Florida school shootings, the old, outdated canard of video games being responsible for the deaths of children was brought up again by then-Kentucky governor Matt Bevin and several other Republican governors. Donald Trump has blamed both violent video games and violent movies and has called for an age regulation system for them, even when both already have an age-rating system. A meeting was scheduled with the Trump administration and members of the video game industry, and absolutely no psychologists nor scientists whatsoever, people who are qualified to talk about the links between violence and video games. During the March 8, 2018 meeting with the video game executives, Trump has showed a cherry-picked montage video of violent video games, in order to cause shock about the content in video games. The said video is currently unlisted, though other channels have picked it up and reposted it. Trump has relied on blaming on video games again after the El Paso and Dayton shootings in 2019, demonstrating that his earlier important meetings discussing video game violence in 2018 were totally effective and that minds were changed.", "Sexism", "See the main article on this topic: Sexism  Primary character by gender, race.", "Sexism has been a problem, both in games and in the gaming community itself (which in turn influences the content in the games due to consumer demand).", "Despite a substantial and growing number of female gamers, there is still an overwhelming tendency for games to star male characters and neglect females, as well as an imbalance in the treatment of male and female archetypes.", "Female gamers themselves are seen as special and denoted as such with terms like \"girl gamer\" or the arguably worse \"gamer girl\". Various excesses of immature behaviour (i.e., nativism, racism, sexism, and heterosexism) are normal in most gaming communities. Many of the more vocal gamers are not happy to be faced with women's rights issues within the scope of their \"light-hearted\" medium and display behaviour ranging from rude to overtly violent, such as the \"Beat Up Anita Sarkeesian\" game, which manages to do both of those, with a heaping spoonful of immaturity thrown in.", "It's been a huge source of outside ridicule and an excuse to not take gamers seriously. This wound is one that even developers admit is self-inflicted. Inaction in the face of blatant sexual harassment in official gaming events is especially notable. Further incidents like \"Gamergate\" don't make it any better, as they both scare off female players and developers, and make games appear more the playground of immature misogynists than a true artform.", "There are several scientific studies on whether video games make people sexist:", "Deskins 2015 (\"The Effects of Video Games on Sexism Attitudes in Males\"), sampling \"117 undergraduate participants (41 men, 76 women)\", found evidence that playing violent video games correlated with finding \"screen shots of a series of sexist chat messages sent to female gamers\" to be amusing (though this doesn't prove causation):", "The relationship between amusement and offensiveness ratings were also examined for how much participants reported playing violent video games. [....] As can be seen in Table 1, a correlation of amusement with violent video game play was also (r(117)= .184 and p= .047).

However, no evidence for a cultivation effect on sexist attitudes was found. [....] Although the findings from the present study are certainly not conclusive, the absence of any longitudinal links between video game use and sexist attitudes at least suggests two things. First, similar to what has been suggested for aggression,38 it is likely that there are factors, such as personal experience and family and peer influences, that affect the development, proliferation, prevention, or reduction of sexist attitudes more strongly than (fictional) media content. Second, general and broad cultivation effects of video games are somewhat unlikely, as players differ in the games they play, and the interactivity of the medium also causes the experience of the same game to differ between players.", "The abstract of Fox et al. 2015 (\"Lifetime Video Game Consumption, Interpersonal Aggression, Hostile Sexism, and Rape Myth Acceptance: A Cultivation Perspective\") reads:", "In this study, we conducted a survey (N = 351) of male and female adults and used structural equation modeling to analyze relationships among video game consumption, trait interpersonal aggression, ambivalent sexism, and first-order (percentage of false rape accusations) and second-order cultivation effects (RMA). We found support for the hypothesized cultivation model, indicating a relationship between video game consumption and RMA via interpersonal aggression and hostile sexism.

As objectification increased, mind attribution decreased and moral status was withdrawn. Although this emerged as a main effect in almost all analyses, Study 2 revealed the important qualifying role of target gender. [....] A particularly worrying original finding of this research is that objectification diminishes a second aspect of personhood, perceived moral status. Whether this reduction precipitates less moral treatment of objectified others is an important question for future research. Study 2 demonstrated that the objectified are assigned more pain tablets, a finding which may indicate that they are seen as less sensitive to pain or that we care less about their suffering.

Merging these insights with objectification theory, we hypothesized that focusing on a woman's, but not a man's, appearance should induce objectification, and thus reduce perceptions of these characteristics. In three studies, females, but not males, were perceived as less competent (Studies 2 and 3) and less warm and moral (Studies 1, 2 and 3) when participants were instructed to focus on their appearance. These findings support our position and help rule out stereotype activation as an alternative explanation to dehumanization.

In terms of hiring, female applicants were generally excluded for not being a \"core gamer\" (heavens knows what that actually means). Negron's former supervisor told her that, \"diversity should not be a focal point of the design of Riot Games' products because gaming culture is the last remaining safe-haven for white teen boys.\" Translation: this the last place where we can act like discriminatory, bigoted assholes. Negron alleges that she had took a managerial position at Riot Games and had no increase in pay and was even discouraged from seeking higher positions, despite her male employee receiving a promotion for doing the same job. Riot Game's response to the lawsuit was a rather generic non-response of \"While we do not discuss the details of ongoing litigation, we can say that we take every allegation of this nature seriously and investigate them thoroughly.

Here's a fun image that actually illustrates this point quite well. This is so obvious that even large corporations like Ubisoft are developing videogames that openly try and break this trend as much as possible such as Far Cry 4. Despite this, Far Cry 4 has been accused of racism against Asians. This form of racism is based on exclusion, where minorities and people of color are either erased, stereotyped or objectified. For example, a study by the European Journal of Cultural Studies showed that Arabs and Muslims were frequently linked to terrorism in video games, promoting vicious stereotypes about both groups. Despite claims to the contrary, black and Latino American gamers are statistically proven to buy more video games and play them more frequently than white American gamers, showing that this erasure isn't an issue of sales.", "Unlike television and movie media of the past, the racism in video games is generally formed from ignorance and erasure rather than outright malice. However, gaming culture itself makes it very hard to bring up the issues of racism (similar to sexism). For example, when gamers playing the obviously racist video game \"Ching-Chong Beautiful\" complete with racial slurs against Asians and highly offensive portrayals of Asians said \"Hey, this is pretty racist\", other gamers told them to calm down because it was fun to play.", "Non-white gamers who comment on racism on video games are either brutally attacked through social media or are ignored. When black gamers asked Bioware why there weren't any black characters in Dragon Age, Bioware's response was an incredibly condescending and borderline bigoted strawman of what the gamers asked complete with the good ol' fashioned \"Why aren't you asking if there aren't any vegetarians in Bioware\" line of bad logic. Many gamers make the claim that they themselves aren't racist for playing a game that is racist. This is also a nasty form of strawman as it tries to individualize an issue that is intrinsic to entire culture. (In other words, your individualism isn't relevant.) ", "While the subject matter of video games may be racist or exclusionary, video games as an activity isn't. Studies show that when people of different ethnicities and races play video games in teams, racism and prejudicial attitudes actually decrease.

However, since the 3DS and Wii U, they do not show the warning every time; the Switch never shows any warning mandatorily.  Notably, its 3DS has a parental control option to turn off the 3D effect (which works differently from 3D TV and movies; for example, it doesn't require special glasses) on settings for young children due to safety concerns. As noted on the boxes of 3DS games, the 3D effect is only enabled if the parental control settings are set for players seven years of age or older (likewise, turning parental controls off entirely leaves use of the 3D effect unrestricted). Up until the 3DS (including the original DS and the Wii), the notifications could not be turned off, but they only required a press of a button to get past and only appeared when the system was turned on, so it ends up less annoying than it sounds. The 3DS only displays the warning when the system is first set up (i.e. when it's fresh out of the box), but includes health and safety application on the system's main menu.", "Sony's PlayStation Portable also has health and safety notifications along the lines of what Nintendo has.

A relatively new theory, it is generally disregarded by science.", "One study by Prof. Ryuta Kawashima suggested that video games impacts the development of the brain by not stimulating the frontal lobe, which the researcher concludes will result in an increasingly violent society. Details of the research are vague and do not show much promise in terms of methodology, as the study compared 30 minutes of adding numbers non-stop with playing a Nintendo game. Beyond the obvious ambiguity, this leads to issues of not considering the unstructured nature of most video games, and the wide range of video game types, both within and beyond Nintendo. The researcher appears to be using beta wave activity as a proxy for frontal lobe activation. A more robust way of collecting this data would be to use an actual fMRI scan. Lack of frontal lobe activation also does not automatically mean that less attention and conscious activity are inherently associated with video games. Individuals who have practiced at a specific task for enough time generally show less activation as the task is \"farmed out\" to unconscious mental processes.", "There is recent research that games are (gasp) good for your brain!

Also, lead researchers of the study concluded that video games may be used even as therapeutic treatment.", "Addiction", "There are also concerns over video game addiction, based on the assumption that video games cause people to become socially introverted, rather than being a release for people who already are.  There is considerable unease in many nations over disproportionate time (and sometimes money) some players spend gaming. In one extreme case a Korean baby died of malnutrition and neglect while her parents spent roughly 12 hours a day raising a \"fantasy child\" online.  Approximately 3% to 8% of gamers are \"pathological players\" associated with anxiety, depression, problems with social and family interaction, poor school and career achievement.  Establishing which is cause and which is effect is difficult.", "MMORPGs and other subscription-based games sometimes take advantage of Skinnerian operant conditioning to ensure a steady cashflow \u2014 but by and large the question of gaming addiction comes down to whether a game is interfering with normal life functions, and the related question of whether it's being used as a substitute for other interaction. The second is not an inherently bad thing; social gaming such as Second Life or MMORPGs often serves as a highly effective social outlet for people who find real world interaction is difficult or uncomfortable. The first, however, is potentially very destructive; unfortunately, people do confuse the two issues regularly.", "To combat the negative aspect of video game addition, China enacted laws to force a time-limitation on Massive Multiplayer Online games, where players that have been playing for three continuous hours begin to receive reduced in-game abilities.  This is only effective in preventing monomania within a monomania, since players are free to switch to another game that does not assign active penalties.", "Societal issues", "Gambling", "Apart from actual gambling games (slot machines, casino games, etc.) there are some disturbing trends in the gaming industry with the practice of loot boxes. Defined, a loot box is a prize pack that can be acquired in game that gives random rewards. The examples we will focus on are available for purchase with real world cash, which can compulse people to gamble on these boxes. In 2007 a Chinese Free-to-play massively multiplayer game invented the modern loot box where you would earn the boxes but have to pay for keys to open them. The most notable first hit in the west to include this are free-to-play mobile games, but over the next decade or so the concept would evolve to include pay-to-play games, such as the traditionally single player series came with Mass Effect 3. In this game there is a multiplayer element that is player-vs-enemy (PvE). Multiplayer characters must be obtained or enhanced with loot boxes which when completing multiplayer elements enhanced the single player experience. Most games would introduce these items as just cosmetics however.", "This came to a head with the success of 2016's Overwatch from Blizzard Entertainment (One half of the Activision Blizzard conglomerate), a pay-to-play game with cosmetic lootboxes occasionally handed out for free or available for purchase. This caught on like wildfire for the industry with many major titles for 2017 now adopting both cosmetic and power based loot boxes. Previous games in some series that relied almost exclusively on acquiring items through leveling up were now being fed through loot boxes while consumers were upset about game balance. In 2017 with the release of Star Wars Battlefront 2 (which caries the same title as a much better game from 2005), Electronic Arts was set to tie multiplayer powers and progression that would devastate game balance to these crates (including some power-ups that allowed for abilities to be used twice as often) until the rights holders (Disney) stepped in and told them to put a stop to it. Unfortunately this system still exists, but you just can't buy the crates for real world money and instead have to grind upwards of 40 hours to unlock one hero (Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, etc.). Post launch, this has become a catalyst for political figures to get involved in games once again, as the system is psychologically exploitative and could prey on unsuspecting children who just want to play Star Wars (the game is rated for teenagers, meaning its easy to buy anywhere with no age restrictions).", "Selected other titles with these elements:", "Halo 5: Guardians - (Microsoft Studios, 343 Industries) Certain modes (all labeled as Warzone) in the game have one-use or permanent cards to gain a tangible advantage that can be earned or bought with real currency. Stated in other terms, a fresh player starts with an unscoped assault rifle and a handgun, whereas tangible upgrades to these exist including scopes, bigger magazines with other guns (marksman rifles, SMGs, soforth) and all game vehicles (from the ATV to the tank) being locked behind these crates. On the other side, Arena matches put all players on equal footing regardless of unlocks and give rewards much like Warzone. So you could play Arena to unlock goodies for Warzone then switch when comfortable.

The backlash was so heated that community moderators threatened to quit their jobs, the review rating tanked, and bad press all around with the player base seeming to tumble out of control overnight. The only way the developer would fix this was to buy the game (as in the intellectual property of the game) from their publisher 505 Games to go independent for $30 million and a cut of the eventual sequel, Payday 3.

The typical Magic booster contains 15 cards consisting of one land, ten common rarities, three uncommon rarities and one rare card. Cross-packs a mythic rare comes in about one-in-eight packs while a foil card comes in one in 70 cards (or one in five boosters). These statistics are easily available from Wizards of the Coast (and printed on packs), so no matter what you bought you knew a bit about what you were getting into. In addition, since these are physical items, a secondary market for them exists. If you, for example, bought a booster with a card you have no use in playing or collecting you can then resell it quite easily or make other use of it, notably, a bookmark. When compared to video games and loot boxes, the rarity odds are often not published anywhere unless required by law or developer agreement. Using Halo 5 as an example, you can buy packs in three flavors saying what rarities are included (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Ultra-Rare, Legendary and Mythic are the rarities), but nothing guaranteed in any one individual box and nothing can be resold/traded to other players. Incidentally, Magic also has several video game versions, most recently: Magic: the Gathering Arena. It has everything you expect from the game, but its free to start, gives you five decks of cards to play with and is completely upfront and honest with its drop rates and costs. To compensate for the lack of a secondary market, if you get a fifth copy of a card (the game locks you at a max of four per deck) it then auto-replaces it with another card from the set of the same rarity. If none are available, you get premium in game currency (as in the game pays you) or progress towards rarer cards. On top of that, as you open packs, you get progress towards \"wild cards\" that allow you to buy any card you want to slot in somewhere.", "A common rebuttal from the industry and gamers alike is that \"it is just cosmetics\" and therefore, they do not directly impact gameplay, which under a bit of scrutiny falls flat. Due to how people play their video games in personal settings, options that cater to how a player wants to enjoy the game causes them to enjoy the game more, and arguably, these enhancements, no matter how minor they may seem, increase a player's enjoyment of the game and is therefore considered a viable part of the experience. Worse tends to be the low value or limited of some of these cosmetics. Overwatch has limited use sprays (allowing players to decal walls with a picture) while Destiny 2 has textures (coloring) that can be used only once and only on a single piece of armor, limiting the ability to skin a whole character. Additionally, if these cosmetic items weren't important, greedy publishers wouldn't gate these items behind these chance pay-walls to begin with (and these items aren't easily ignored) and wouldn't have developed a lucrative system behind scamming people who have gambling impulses to purchase loot boxes in hopes that it may contain a skin they would wish to use. Furthermore, many of these items used to be actually part of the game (see above example: Forza Motorsport 7) and used to be actual in-game rewards, and many games still today use aesthetically pleasing costume pieces as rewards for playing the game rather than asking players to play upfront, recent examples being Super Mario Odyssey and Sonic Forces.", "Another common rebuttal is that loot boxes are simply up to the discretion of the player to buy them, and all of the negative consequences are up to the individual player weighing the risks and rewards and coming to their own conclusion to make that decision. The problem with this argument is that the game psychologically manipulates the players in many ways to get them to part with their money, such as badgering them with notifications on a main menu to purchase these items, as well as forcing players to either go through endless amounts of tedium and grinding to possibly earn a crate that houses that said item if they choose not to pay extra. In many of these cases, most players have already paid 60 dollars for the game they are playing, the last thing they need is a game persuading them to part with even more cash. This is about as much choice the player has as with people who have psychological problems with gambling, and this is the main reason gambling is restricted for adults only.", "Beyond that is the derogatory language used to describe the playerbase, derived from casino terminology. The most common word is \"Whale\" referring to someone who would spend large amounts of money on any particular game (casinos also call them \"High Rollers\", who would bet large amounts) with similar terms being \"Dolphins\" for those who spend a fair amount on a game and \"Krill\" for those who spend nearly nothing. Whales tend to share similarities to people with gambling addictions, making it very obvious the ingrained problems with these models."]},

In fact, those who bring up cases like rape and life of the mother are doing so because, deep inside, they themselves know that choosing to murder another human being is justifiable only under such extreme circumstances, and NOT for abortion on demand.

Yet, even if we were to take plaintiffs\u2019 legal position that the legislature cannot constitutionally interfere with a woman\u2019s right to do as she will with her own body so long as no harm is done to others, the argument does not support the conclusion plaintiffs would have us draw from it. For we cannot say the New York legislature lacked a rational basis for considering that abortion causes such harm.

She said, \"I have three sisters with breast cancer and I resent people messing with the scientific data to further their own agenda, be they pro-choice or pro-life.

He showed that abortion was the best predictor of breast cancer in Britain.  Breast cancer is the only cancer in Britain which has its highest incidence and mortality rate among the upper rather than lower social classes.  Abortion before a full term pregnancy and late pregnancy were the best explanations for this incidence.  He also found that there had been a 70% increase risk of breast cancer between 1971 and 2002 and that for women between 50 and 54 years of age incidence was highly correlated with abortion.", "Demographic evidence of abortion causing breast cancer includes the following.  Breast cancer rates are far lower in Western countries that prohibited abortion than in those that promoted it.  Ireland, which virtually bans abortion, reportedly has a lifetime rate of breast cancer of only 1 in 13, nearly half the rate of 1 in 7.5 in the United States.  The rate of breast cancer increases steadily as one travels from Ireland, where abortion is illegal, to Northern Ireland, where abortion is legal but rare, to England, where abortion is common. ", "In Romania, abortion was illegal under two decades of rule by the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, and the country enjoyed one of the lowest breast cancer rates in the entire world during that time, far lower than comparable Western countries. Romania's breast cancer rate was an astounding one-sixth the rate of the United States.  But after the execution of Ceausescu on Christmas Day, 1989, Romania has taken the opposite approach, embracing abortion to the point that Romania now has one of the highest abortion rates in the world.  One Romanian observer decried, \"The liberalization of abortions in Romania in 1990, the significant increase of the number of abortions at relatively short intervals, determined a rise in the incidence of breast and uterine cervix cancer in my country.\"", "Studies on rats, which are an accepted method for identifying causes of cancer in humans,  further confirm that abortion does indeed increase the risk of breast cancer.

Since this study indicates that the ice layer survived the last interglacial, it has led to speculation that the ice caps may be able to also withstand global warming. However, the main author of the study \"dismissed\" suggestions that his team's data indicated that sea levels would not rise to predicated levels, saying that \"during the last interglacial, sea levels rose by 5-6m, but this must have come from other sources additional to the Greenland ice cap, such as Antarctic ice.

The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has been relatively constant for hundreds of thousands of years due to output and input being equal. What humans are doing is burning and releasing natural carbon sinks, therefore releasing CO2, without creating additional carbon sinks. This means the net amount of CO2 is increasing over time due to our involvement even though our total output is less than natural sources.", "One of the interesting things is that the natural outputs of CO2 and the human-made outputs contain different isotopes. Fossil fuel burning outputs CO2 that has less 14C and 13C than do natural sources. Using tree ring dating it can be shown that the proportion of 14C-containing CO2 in the atmosphere decreased substantially prior to the 1940s, when the largely defensive weapon of atomic bomb actually negated our ability to use that test. But 13C testing confirmed the 14C testing and showed that fossil fuel burning is the number-one contributor to the increase in the CO2 in the atmosphere.", "Volcanic activity, specifically underwater volcanic activity, is often cited (usually drawing on the writings of Ian Plimer) as producing more CO2 than humans. This, however, is demonstrably false. So-called large igneous provinces, mostly lava flows of huge volume (millions of cubic kilometers) that erupt over a few million years, may be associated with rapid global warming, but none have erupted in the past five million years. Within human history, volcanic eruptions tend to have a cooling effect due to emission of sulfur aerosols.", "Oddly enough, some denialists also point out the significant amounts of CO2 created by livestock, and somehow totally ignore that these animals are bred and kept by humans, ergo making it human-made emissions. Clearly it is (anthropogenic) burning of fossil fuels that is responsible.", "A more bizarre claim was made by Tom DeWeese of the American Policy Center, namely that trees give off CO2 instead of absorbing it. He also claimed that environmentalism was the work of Communist leaders bent on destroying the freedoms of the West after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which indicates that live audio and Dunning-Kruger often go hand in hand. Scientific studies prove Global Warming can not be caused by natural forces alone.", "Even if it was not the cause that humans are causing global warming, this is absolutely not a reason to not do something about it. It would be just as dumb of a decision as doing nothing about an incoming earthquake, hurricane, typhoon or volcano eruption simply because those aren't caused by humans.", "CO2 levels lag behind temperature increases", "There have been several major changes in the Earth's climate over its 4.5-billion year history. These have included spectacular effects such as the snowball earth and periods of intense global warming. These periods of warming and cooling all have a range of causes mostly involving positive feedback loops, such as ice reflecting the sun back to space causing more ice, reflecting more sun, and Milankovitch cycles, variations in Earth's orbit that have an effect on climate. The warming had similar positive feedback loops, which initially could have been caused by one of many factors but eventually the warming increased the levels of CO2 which then caused even more warming. The fact that CO2 level increases have not been responsible for the start of 100 percent of all global warming events on the planet does not negate the fact that CO2 in the atmosphere does cause warming. Indeed, given that CO2 does not lag the current warming is one more piece of evidence demonstrating that established natural cycles are not the cause of the warming.", "Water vapour is a more important greenhouse gas", "Water vapour is one of the most potent greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere and accounts for a substantial portion of the greenhouse effect that raises the Earth's temperature from an inhospitable 19 degrees below zero to a more temperate 16 degrees above zero. Global warming denialists have used this to claim that carbon dioxide (CO2) is an unimportant gas in the greenhouse effect \u2014 and this can be coupled with the fact that burning fossil fuels (oxidation) results in the release of water vapour in addition to carbon dioxide.", "However, this argument that CO2 is not the cause of global warming misses (possibly intentionally) several key facts. First, water vapour is often saturated in the atmosphere. At high altitudes, where the temperature is low, water vapour cools and condenses to form clouds, and if the water droplets are big enough, this leads to rain. The amount of water vapour, therefore, is largely dependent on the temperature. Adding water to the atmosphere may alter weather patterns but its concentration does not differ on the scales considered by climate scientists. As it is removed from the atmosphere on a fast time scale, it can cause short lived but extreme changes in temperature, and so is the cause of much freak, but short-term, weather. Carbon dioxide on the other hand has a much longer life-time in the atmosphere and its concentration is not capped by saturation in the atmosphere. This makes the effect that CO2 has on the Earth's climate a considerable force.", "It has been hotter in the past so it is just cyclical", "While it is true that there have been cyclical patterns of temperature changes throughout our planet's history, this does not mean that causes are unknown, unknowable, or all the same. The application of the scientific method is great for working out cause/effect relationships. Scientists have managed to link several warming and cooling cycles in the geologic history to specific causes. They have also shown that the modern warming is due to the added output of humans burning fossil fuels and destroying carbon sinks.  In addition, the current climate change is happening fast \u2014 over a period of decades rather than millennia.  Past natural climatic patterns that were destructive were associated with cool periods while the projected future catastrophe from AGW is going to be associated with warming; this makes man-made climate change much worse than naturally occurring climate change.", "The existence of previous warming cycles does not negate the seriousness of the current one. These previous cycles destroyed a great deal of life on the planet, and if similar effects occurred today they could potentially destroy all of human civilization, along with the humanity that created it. This does mean that the earth itself will survive, but no denialist would be around to gloat.", "Global warming has more to do with the Sun than the Earth", "Changes in the Sun have not been responsible for recent climatic trends; there has not been any significant change in the total energy output of the sun since we have started measuring it, and no changes in the sun or sun phenomena correlate with increased temperatures. One thing that can change is small perturbations in the orbit of the Earth that draw the planet closer to or further from the sun. These perturbations might be linked to the start of several of the major climate changes in the geologic history of the Earth. Nonetheless, the actual change in temperature due to these orbital changes is small and the large-scale changes are due to feedback loops localized to Earth pushing things in one direction or another. ", "There is no evidence that such an orbital shift is happening now, but even if it has, it can only explain a very small percentage of the increase in global temperature. This issue was also a point of contention in the Soon and Baliunas controversy.", "It must be the sun because Mars and Pluto are warming too", "Many of the planets and moons (and a certain dwarf planet) in our solar system are big enough and geologically active enough to have both an atmosphere and a climate. In any given system there will be some planets increasing in temperature and some decreasing in temperature. This is due to changes in the localized climate, just as it is with Earth. The causes are different for each planet and have little to no bearing on each other. ", "Even if the sun does have a role, it is not likely that our own activities are helping the situation. It would actually be even more incentive to temper our works, because anthropogenic activity combined with solar activity obviously equals even higher rates of warming.", "Urban heat islands", "This point contends that weather station readings are affected by their proximity to cities, or \"urban heat islands.\" See the article on Patrick Michaels, a notable proponent of this argument, for a treatment of this point.", "  Denialists love to cherry pick every slight raise to make it seem that Arctic sea ice has stopped melting.", "Hey look!  There's been no global warming since 1998", "One of the most popular claims made against climate science is that there has been \"no global warming since 1998,\" or even that there has been a pattern of \"global cooling\" since that year. Denialists who have made this argument include Tim Ball, Nigel Lawson, Fred Singer, Andrew Bolt and Christopher Monckton. The origins of this argument are unclear; perhaps it might have originated in a column by Bob Carter which appeared the Daily Telegraph in 2006.", "This argument fails for several reasons: it only takes into account the satellite measurements (UAH and RSS), which doesn't measure directly the surface temperatures. Not only are these satellites run by known deniers John Christy and Roy Spencer, but they are funded in part by Exxon. No conflict of interest there! By contrast, both scientifically accepted surface temperature datasets (GISS and HATCET4) are only funded by government sources, and they show that the warming not only continues, but is accelerating in lock and step with the CO2 emissions. Most importantly, this is one of the finest examples of cherry picking since deniers only look at the data sets that match the conclusions they want to see. Classic climate denialism demands that average global temperature measurements must be taken from the peak of the hottest year and measured to the point trough of the coolest year.  If the denialists ever picked years either side of 1998 as their start point, the argument would sink faster than the Titanic.  This is because globally, 1998 was a record breaking hot year due to a very strong El Nino. Additionally, another strong El Nino in 2015-16 caused temperatures to soar far past those seen in 1998, so they now have to ignore that time has been passing since 2014 as even their beloved RSS shows a record hot year.", "Using anecdotal evidence", "  So much for global warming!", "Using arguments such as \"Wow, it's really cold today!

It will start with poorer countries in the region, but eventually, wealthier countries in the region will collapse due to either the migrant crisis or temperatures getting too hot for technology to balance it out anymore. As the crisis spreads, extremism will explode as opinions on what to do contradict each other. Some major powers may go crazy and begin performing border massacres and invasions, in an attempt to stop the wave of migrants and impending economic collapse as a result of the collapse of cheap labor and the potential rise of autarky. Internal migration will likely become an issue in some nations as parts such as the American Southwest begin to lose inhabitability to desertification.

Proponents of GMF claim that GM technology has been the subject of a manufactroversy and accuse opponents of spreading misinformation through the media.

Spraying with this herbicide kills the weeds without affecting the HT crop. This allows the farmer to easily avoid tillage. Tillage is normally done to control weeds, but accelerates soil erosion. HT crops usually require more herbicides than traditional ones, but the broad spectrum herbicides used on HT crops are typically less toxic than traditional selective herbicides, leading to a net reduction of the environmental footprint. Corn, canola, soy, and sugar beets are examples of common HT crops.", "Bt toxin production: Bt toxins are proteins produced by the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis which are lethal to some species of insect pests, primarily moths and beetles. Bt extract is often used as an insecticide in organic farming. When an insect attempts to feed off a plant that produces a Bt toxin, it quickly dies. Bt crops require significantly less insecticides than their traditional counterparts, and more importantly, kill only the insects that feed on the plant, thus impacting the surrounding environment even less.

Arguably in the event of a national disaster, it's for the best that the supply chain is as simple as possible just in case, however there are some legitimate uses. It's helpful if you need to make sure that the plant doesn't breed with wild cousins, or if you want to make sure your crops don't sprout if they get wet. It does however see some use outside of agriculture; mosquitos can be bred en masse with an intentionally defective gene that only lets larvae survive in a lab. The defective mosquitos are released into an environment and breed naturally with the local mosquitos, and the next generation of mosquitos mostly die off.

FDA regulations require new GM strains to be tested for things like allergen potential and toxicity, but these tests are allowed to be conducted by the manufacturers (with FDA oversight), which may lead to biased studies.

Historically, this has resulted in the disastrous release into the marketplace of the Lenape potato and celery containing excessive psoralens. To conclude, although testing that is funded by the manufacturers is not ideal (independently funded studies reduce the introduction of many forms of possible biases such as the sunk cost fallacy, confirmation bias, and/or bias blind spots), any testing is better than no testing (also consider that manufacturers have a vested interest in protecting their PR image, which when dealing with GMFs is already poisoning the well, and introducing harmful products could damage that image quickly).", "Food allergies", "The rise in food allergies correlates to the rise of GMFs.

The rise in allergies is a common phenomenon in developed countries, even though the popularity of GMF varies wildly between them. Furthermore, new proteins introduced by genetic modification are required to have short digestion times in order to be found fit for human consumption, precisely because long-digestion proteins are potential allergens.

However, there are several issues with concluding that this is because of GMF. First, organic crops are often sprayed with Cry1Ab. Second, the recorded levels of the protein would require ridiculous consumption of corn (up to 5.8 kg for the maximum recorded blood level, and at minimum 120 g) every single day, since Cry1Ab does not bioaccumulate. Third, the authors recorded values lower than their minimum detection value, and their detection method is flawed.

A \"superweed\" is a plant that's resistant to the herbicide in use, allowing it to grow in the fields we'd rather use for crops, rather than a green monster that will overwhelm the whole world.  Much like \"superbugs\" in hospitals, acquiring resistance to an herbicide is generally harmful to the plant if the herbicide is not present, as it requires the plant to spend additional energy and materials producing the proteins or other chemicals it uses to endure the herbicide, meaning \"superweeds\" are actually slightly weaker and less invasive than the, umm, garden variety.

Without the herbicide present, the tolerant plants tend to be pushed out by the intolerant plants.", "On the other hand, the newly introduced traits might disrupt the ecosystem surrounding a GMF field, particularly when GMFs interbreed with wild relatives.

Therefore, new seed must be bought every year from a plant breeder to keep its desirable characteristics.", "One of the few dangers of GURT would be in those rare cases if it were to fail. GURT is engineered as a genetic trait, which means it can and will mutate, and a germline mutation that deactivates the GURT geneplex would mean the seeds would be fertile.

Another study, published in 2005 found that using GMF that poison pests reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the need for pesticide spraying. Additionally, GMF which is modified for no-till or reduced-till farming systems (herbicide resistant crops) reduce the energy use in soil cultivation, again lowering overall greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA has required some insect resistant crops be regulated like chemical pesticides.  Developing countries see greater benefit to yields, and reductions in pesticide use, from using genetically modified crops, giving complaints about them just a touch of classism.", "Some articles argue that the repression of GMF by the environmental movement is the real problem.

That said, when asked, 80 percent of Americans said they wanted food to be labeled if it contained DNA. As just about all food from whatever source is going to contain DNA this tends to suggest that the pro-label lobby is perhaps not the most scientifically literate.", "In the U.S.", "Until July 2016, there were no mandatory labeling requirements for GMFs at the federal level in the United States. There were, however, state laws in Vermont, Maine, and Connecticut, which would have imposed labeling requirements on GM foods sold in those states if and when they went into effect.", "In response, a bill called the \"Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act\" was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in July of 2015, which would have prohibited individual states from imposing their own GM food labeling requirements. GM food opponents called this bill \"Denying Americans the Right to Know,\" or the DARK Act..  It passed the House, but was blocked by the Senate.", "A later compromise to the above bill, titled only \"S. 764\", passed the House and Senate and was signed into law on 29 July, 2016. This law, christened \"the DARK Act 2.0\" by its opponents, mandates GMO labels but allows the information to be contained in QR codes (2-D bar codes that can't be read without the aid of a smartphone or similar device). It may also permit some loopholes for certain classes of GM food, and voids all state-level GMO labeling laws.", "In Canada", "There are no requirements for GM foods to be labeled as such in Canada. Furthermore, non-GM foods can only be labeled as non-GM if GM versions of their ingredients exist on the market, or an accompanying statement is made saying no GM version exists. (This is similar to how the U.S. FDA regulates the statement \"cholesterol-free.\") This law should also apply to \"The Non-GMO Project\" certification logo, but is only sporadically enforced.", "In the European Union", "European Union has very strict GMF labeling laws, mandating that every ingredient of the product that was produced from genetically modified organisms must be labelled, even if it contains no DNA and is chemically indistinguishable from its non-GMF counterpart (e.g. oils, lecithin, and sugar). Labeling is also mandatory in restaurant menus. Combined with the very high level of anti-GMF activity in Europe and the fact that only two GM traits have been approved for local cultivation (one variant of Bt corn, and  the Amflora potato), this results in GMF being basically impossible to buy.", "Labeling in Europe is not required for the meat, eggs and milk of animals fed with GMFs. Most European poultry and pigs are in fact fed GM cereals imported from the United States, as this is significantly cheaper than feeding them locally grown non-GM grain.", "A common claim about European labeling laws is that cultivating GMFs in some area would automatically require honey produced in the same area to be labeled as genetically modified, because honey contains trace amounts of pollen (less than 0.5%). Given the anti-GMF hysteria, the label would make such honey potentially unmarketable in Europe. However, this is no longer true, as the rules were recently clarified; pollen is now considered as a \"natural constituent\" rather than an \"ingredient\" of honey, and so it only needs to be labelled if the honey contains more than 0.9% of GM pollen. Previous ruling from the European Court of Justice stipulated that pollen is an \"ingredient\" and therefore needs to be included on the ingredient list, and a label must be included if more than 0.9% of the pollen is genetically modified.", "Deliberate Misinformation", "Misinformation on the subject is harmful.

Illegal immigrants oftentimes have a better standard of living and are treated better than even American citizens in multiple aspects.

The mainstream media is heavily biased in favor of illegal immigration even to the point of favoring illegals over American citizens. While the political establishment estimates that only 11 million illegals live in the U.S., the actual number is most likely closer to 22 million. Illegals are known to engage in voter fraud. Liberals, who are increasingly supportive of illegal and mass migration, count them as part of their electorate, despite not holding legal voting rights, and they support having illegals vote in elections \u2013 illegals support Democrats in elections. Accordingly, left-wingers have accordingly pursued policies that result in putting illegals above the law. Similar to how the Southern states used imported slaves to increase their representation in Congress, liberals do the same with illegal migrants and low-wage workers. Liberals also support illegal immigration as it will increase the size of government. Rather than acknowledge the numerous other problems created by mass illegal immigration, open borders activists often claim that the only problem is ensuring proper care of the children migrating. Establishment, globalist Republicans also support mass migration, even if illegal, because of the cheap labor it provides. Some left-wing activists justify illegal immigration by saying illegal aliens are \"reclaiming\" land the U.S. \"stole,\" thus admitting the term \"invasion\" is a justifiable description.", "The economic and financial cost of illegal immigration to the U.S. falls on American citizens, and it hurts black Americans particularly hard.

The existence of \"Josephite marriages\" is another example of this dispute, where soulmates are officially married but also committed to celibacy. By the 4th century, the now-Christianised Roman Empire quickly outlawed and condemned same-sex marriages under Emperor Constantine II. This did not rule out marriage for later Christian states, however, as the Kingdom of Galicia allowed at least one church wedding in 1061. After a thousand years of squabbling, the Catholic Church finally banned same-sex marriages outright in the 1400s, replacing it with a civil partnership known as \"brother-making\", which may have entailed homosexuality in individual cases, however evidence is highly questionable.

Their belief is that if two adults love each other, that is insufficient grounds to allow marriage\u2014siblings who love each other cannot marry, for example, and an adult who loves a child or their golden retriever cannot marry them. Incest (in the meaning of sexual encounter between 2 closely related beings capable of producing a child), however, differs from same-sex marriage in that there is a higher than usual risk that a child born to the closely related couple could suffer genetic defects. Bestiality and adult-child marriages are also a violation of informed consent, which is the biggest flaw of that argument.

The Religious Right often attempts to argue against gay marriage by conflating gay marriage with civil unions, and deliberately trying to whitewash over the possibility of civil unions as an intermediate step between no-rights and marriage.

If it's not necessarily the same reason, then each practice can be considered and rejected/accepted on its own terms.

The argument holds that the \"gay lobby\" only wants gay marriage to be a starting point.  Next will be gay adoption, IVF and surrogacy (all of which exist in Australia already).  After that will come the lowering of the age of consent and polygamy/polyandry.  After that, siblings will be allowed to marry.  Once this agenda has been realised, the stage will be set for the legalisation of bestiality and \"inter-species marriage\".

This is fallacious regardless of whether or not polygamy and incest are objectively wrong. Even if hypocrisy is a consequence accepting gay rights and rejecting the parade of prophesied horribles, it doesn't follow that avoiding personal hypocrisy is more important than expanding civil rights. After all, if hypocrisy is to be avoided, we shouldn't see so many advocates of a limited government that stays out of people's private affairs advocating for the government to decide who may and may not get married.", "The argument further misses the fact that in many countries bestiality was a legal practice until the 21st century, when several countries started to make it punishable by law, which is in itself also around the same time that same-sex marriage became allowed in many countries. While correlation is not causation \u2014 and the penalizing of bestiality is more due to demands from animal rights activists more than anything else \u2014 it is more than enough reason to assume that that slippery-slope doesn't work, as you don't see those same animal rights activists organizing protests in favor of the abolishing of same-sex marriage.", "Slouching toward NAMBLA", "Just look at all those other countries that legalised gay marriage, they were marrying pedos to kids within a matter of.. well.. that actually hasn't happened anywhere at all, but it's a matter of time!", "This ignores the fact that homosexual love was accepted for decades before gay marriage was legalised, while pedophile love is still considered totally unacceptable by almost everyone; hence a major change in attitude would be needed for marrying 8 year olds to be considered.

The argument goes that since procreation is generally the result of sexual union between a man and a woman, recognizing same-sex marriage doesn't make any sense. However, they fail to note the generally. Same-sex couples can also procreate (rather than adopt) through IVF or surrogacy, albeit with some more red tape and planning to go through. Scientists are also working on ways to make sperm from eggs, make eggs from stem cells, and grow babies in artificial womb, so in the near future, there won't even be the need for a donor.", "This also ignores the fact that procreation is not a requirement for heterosexual marriage. Child benefit is just one of many legal and tax benefits given to married couples, such as spousal social security benefits, medicare and other medical benefits, estate planning benefits, disability benefits, employment benefits, death benefits, family benefits such as right to property, housing benefits, consumer benefits such as tuition and insurance discounts, allowing filings of wrongful death suits, marital communication privileges, visiting rights, and more, alongside simply giving them the opportunity to register their commitment to one another and have it acknowledged by the state. None of these are taken away if a couple fails to produce children on a regular basis, as they are there to provide stability to a committed couple, regardless of how many crying screaming sods bundles of joy they wish to have.", "Also, to follow the logic of \"marriage is for procreation\", then we shouldn't be giving marriage licenses to people who have had vasectomies/tied tubes, or people just naturally sterile, or even the guy that got hit too hard in the soccer balls with a soccer ball.", "The procreation argument alone should be insulting for those involved in an honest relationship. To define marriage as simply a vehicle for procreation undermines the deeper relationships and meaning of marriage. So much for \"defense of marriage\". If anything, the argument is insulting to children, as it determines their worth in numbers, rather than how they are cared for. Better to raise one child or none in a stable working household than bring three into one that cannot support them.

Both judges ruled that procreation was not a valid argument because heterosexual couples who were elderly (e.g. post-menopausal), infertile or otherwise making a conscious decision not to have children were not subject to the same ban that same sex couples were. Judge Terence Kern noted in his decision for the US District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma that \"civil marriage... does not have any procreative prerequisites,\" and concluded that \"permitting same-sex couples to receive a marriage license does not harm, erode, or somehow water-down the 'procreative' origins of the marriage institution.\" ", "Lesbian sperm thieves", "David Usher of RenewAmerica warns that women will, given the slightest opportunity, all marry each other, thus taking all the legal privilege from men, and use the men only as a source of sperm.

It pretends that same-sex marriage somehow devalues \"real\" marriage since the big man in the sky has the patent on it. Science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer has an excellent rebuttal to this argument on his blog by contrasting the debasement of a title (professor) by awarding it to persons \"who (a) hadn\u2019t obtained the highest academic degree in their discipline and (b) had done no original research he felt debased the term\" with gay marriage which \"doesn\u2019t cheapen, diminish, or reduce anyone\u2019s marriage\" and \"takes nothing away from anyone else.\"", "No marriage at all", "A rare argument, typically seen among libertarians, is that not only should the state not sanction same-sex marriage, but that it should get out of the marriage business altogether.

(Advocates of the no-marriage solution rarely seem to spend their time evangelising this view to married heterosexuals). They also don't address the issue of rights, privileges, and benefits associated with marriage. As these include matters where the state has a compelling interest, such as property rights that can frequently end up in dispute, the state has no choice but to get involved in some way so as to maintain order.", "Another Libertarian prescription would be to provide civil unions for all, and let churches perform marriages which would have no legal standing. This system exists in several European countries; a legally binding civil ceremony is required, but the option exists to have an additional church ceremony for those who want it. The American system is actually very similar to this; however, due to legal language, the term \"civil union\" presents a case of \"separate but equal,\" and the Supreme Court has previously ruled the term (in Brown v. Board of Education) to be a paradox: inherently impossible. Because the rights and privileges are currently tied to the specific term \"marriage,\" nothing less than marriage (in the legal sense) is considered acceptable. Meanwhile, proponents correctly argue that the religious ceremony is irrelevant to this case and is not being argued. It is the legal status associated with the civil ceremony that is at issue. 2012 Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson initially supported a variety of this that would involve changing every instance of the word \"marriage\" in every bit of government regulation to instead say \"civil union\", thus theoretically satisfying the constitutional argument, but changed his mind to support full marriage equality once he realized how impractical his proposal was.", "Shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, libertarian-leaning Reason Magazine argued that the long-term goal of eliminating government-sponsored marriage entirely was no reason to oppose same-sex marriage in the short term. They compared this to a hypothetical situation where the government passed a law forbidding blacks from driving on interstate highways - clearly it would not be enough for libertarians to declare that government should not own the roads and leave it at that. They thus argued the similar argument against same-sex marriage is equally invalid. The article went as far as to say there is no solid libertarian argument against same-sex marriage. In other words, even from a libertarian perspective, this argument makes no sense.", "Hurts parenting", "The argument that children should not be raised by same-sex couples has been debunked extensively. Scientific research has consistently shown that homosexual parents are just as effective as heterosexual parents, and the psychological well-being of children reared by same-sex couples is not worse than that of children raised by opposite-sex parents. In fact, same-sex couples and their children are likely to benefit greatly from legal recognition through marriage, more so than civil unions. Recent studies from 2011 added a tantalizing suggestion that not only are gay couples \"equal\" parents to straight couples, they might even be better on average for two reasons. 1) Gay couples are more likely to have chosen the time and place for children.  Gay couples cannot accidentally get pregnant, or have more children than they want, and 2) Gay couples (and this is true of any child raised outside of the 'norm') generally expose kids to more diversity in their relationships and the children are raised with more tolerance.", "Arguments about children and reproduction", "Conservatives might shout \"Won't somebody think of the children?\" and defend the norm of the heterosexual nuclear family. Of course, some children have same-sex parents, and contrary to flawed studies, credible research can't seem to find any difference between them and children raised by opposite-sex parents. Ironically, homophobic policies like bans on same-sex marriage diminish the ability of same-sex parents to form stable households, harming their children. So yes, won't somebody think of the children indeed?", "\"Children need a male and a female role model\"", "A child has many opportunities to find role models; such role models don't need to be legal guardians of the child.

The modern version of this is day nurseries, schools, sports clubs, the uncle that gives you a job, etc. So we humans have always had more than just our biological parents to raise us, and there were always enough women and men around (unless the child is raised on Mount Athos.) One could even argue, that all groups of social animals do exactly the same, even if in more primitive forms.", "This argument is also not an argument against same-sex marriage but against same-sex parenting, which opponents of homosexuality frequently conflate. If you truly believe in the social good of marriage and long-term relationships, but dislike gay people being parents, then given that gay people are parents (from sperm donation, surrogacy, adoption or previous relationships with heterosexuals), they should probably prefer that gay parents are in long term stable relationships... but they never quite seem to get around to seeing the validity of this point.", "\"Children should be raised by their biological parents\"", "There is little convincing evidence to back up this somewhat arbitrary claim, as a child's development is determined by the relationship and interactions with a parent, rather than pure genetic relationship.

Second, it ignores that humans, gay humans included, are part of nature too and therefore have as much right to define it. Third, it implies that if something is unnatural, it is bad.

Further, free exercise does not include hate crimes. Finally, speech against homosexuality - like all hate speech - is protected by the First Amendment, to a degree.  Combined with the issue that, at the federal level, Congress is not allowed to pass laws that are purely for religious purposes because of the First Amendment, and religious opposition has no legal ground to stand on.  This also applies at the state level with the inclusion of the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibiting rights being denied without a secular cause (due process).

However gay rights have, thus far, only been advocated on substantive due process grounds (building from the due process clause), as in Lawrence v. Texas.  The same case ardently refused to address gay rights as an equal protection issue, and refused especially to suggest that gay rights deserve any special protection under the equal protection clause.

In Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court invalidated a Virginia statute which voided and forbade any marriage between members of different races (miscegenation).  The aptly named Lovings successfully sued Virginia to invalidate the law, although it took the Supreme Court to win a favorable verdict.", "In the opinion, the Supreme Court struck the statute largely on equal protection grounds, finding that the statute improperly set up a racial hierarchy and perpetuated repression and discrimination against African-Americans.  Virginia had defended against this argument on the basis that the statute was \"formally equal\"; it did not hurt African-Americans any more than Caucasians.  Neither could marry the other.  This formal equality, Virginia argued, was dispositive of any discrimination claim.  In finding against Virginia, the Supreme Court employed its rarely used \"Get Real!\" technique; regardless of formal equality, said the Court, everyone knew the real impetus behind the law, and couching its defense in legal formalities would not allow the court to overlook this great inequity.  This case was a great victory for the civil rights movement.", "This was the holding of the case - or, its primary legal significance.  Importantly, though, as an afterthought, the Court tossed in one comment at the very end of the opinion, saying that the Court had no need to reach the argument that the due process clause could protect, as fundamental to the American way of life, the right to marry.  Although merely one line of dicta, this line suggests that the Court at one point recognized a fundamental right to marry.", "A theoretical argument for same-sex marriage could make use of this dicta, defining marriage as a \"fundamental right\" which is \"deeply rooted\" in the nation's history, implicit in the concept of \"ordered liberty,\" and the restriction of this right should be struck down upon strict scrutiny unless it is \"narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest.\" The Supreme Court has consistently held that such rights are due protection. Opponents will rebut, exclaiming that gay marriage is not a fundamental right - and therefore should be subject to the comparatively lighter form of judicial review, rational basis review.  The dicta in Loving, proponents can argue, suggests otherwise.", "Even if evaluating gay marriage under substantive due process triggers only rational basis review, though, restrictions on gay marriage arguably fail even this moderate test.

The objection is based upon the assumption by said conservatives that sexual preference, unlike race, is not inborn (immutable).  The obvious objection is that, in fact, sexual preference is immutable, or, if not immutable, is so highly correlative with personal identity that it defies classification as a \"choice,\" and should still be legally protected.  A more appropriate analogy than race, in this case, would be religion - religion is a choice, although a deeply personal choice - and therefore, the law protects (and should protect) individuals from discrimination on the basis of such deep choices (and it does, in the case of religion).", "On the other side of the political spectrum, some adherents of racial identity politics also maintain that analogies between racism and homophobia are false, their specific beef being the gay campaign against \"don't ask, don't tell.\" Activist Sharon Martinas puts it this way: \"Some queer activists, whose movement was started by queers of color at Stonewall, focus their struggle on the right to become equal opportunity murderers of peoples of color in the U.S. military. And we use false analogies between homophobic and racial oppression to justify demands for these 'equal rights.'\"", "These objections are, at least in the context of American constitutional law, spurious: Loving v. Virginia did not rely on race as a unique distinguishing category but on its conclusion (for which reason it was instrumental in developing substantive due process) that no state interest whatsoever benefited from excluding particular people from marriage. The decision in that case pointed out that marriage is a critically significant (and private) individual choice (outside the opinion, it's notable that even convicted murderers on death row are accorded the right to marry) and weighed restrictions on marriage as being presumptively unconstitutional and requiring the state to individually justify any limitations on it.", "Conduct or status?", "Although marriage has traditionally been described as a status \u2014 a quality that inheres as a result of a legal imprimatur \u2014 gay rights activists have increasingly sought to characterize marriage as a type of conduct.  This characterization is a deliberate legal and rhetorical strategy that builds upon the fact that, although marriage fits more neatly within the description of a \"status,\" certain aspects of marriage \u2014 the fact of the couple's presentment to the community as a joined entity, as well as the personal expression qualities of engaging in a marital relationship \u2014 suggest that marriage can be defined at least partially as a type of conduct.", "This new characterization has important ramifications for the law of same-sex marriage.  As discussed in Lawrence v. Texas, homosexual conduct is protected at a high level - somewhere between rational basis review and strict scrutiny.  Status, though, is protected at a low level.

Mr Kraft went on to summarize what the West did and is doing which is important in Iraq, quote:", "(1)We deposed Saddam Hussein. Although Saddam Hussein was not directly involved in 9/11, it is not disputed that Saddam had been actively supporting certain terrorist groups for decades. Saddam was a mass-murdering totalitarian dictator responsible for the deaths more than one million Iraqis and arguably for the as many as 400,000 Iraqis and Iranians who died in the Iran-Iraq War.", "(2) We created a battle, a confrontation, a flash point, with Islamic terrorism in Iraq. This has focused the battle. The ones killed there won't have to be killed here, or somewhere else. We have a good shot at creating a democratic, peaceful Iraq, which will be a catalyst for democratic change in the rest of the Middle East, and an outpost for a stabilizing American military presence in the Middle East for as long as it is needed.

", "The bottom line here is that we will have to deal with Islamic terrorism until we defeat it (or are defeated by it), whenever that is. It will not go away on its own. The history of the world is the clash between the forces of relative civility and civilization, and the barbarians clamoring at the gates. The Iraq war is merely another battle in this ancient and never-ending war. Now, for the first time ever, the barbarians are about to get nuclear weapons unless WE prevent them.

If any child is without food or medicine or a roof over his or her head in Iraq, it\u2019s because he is claiming the sanctions are doing it and sticking it to his own children.

Now those Iraqi children are better off than before the war. Child mortality figures have more than doubled in the south and center of the country, where the Iraqi government\u2014rather than the UN\u2014controls the program. If a turn-around on child mortality can be made in the north, which is under the same sanctions as the rest of the country, there is no reason it cannot be done in the south and center. The fact of the matter is, however, that the government of Iraq does not share the international community's concern about the welfare of its people. Baghdad's refusal to cooperate with the oil-for-food program and its deliberate misuse of resources are cynical efforts to sacrifice the Iraqi people's welfare in order to bring an end to UN sanctions without complying with its obligations.\"", "Michael Rubin, adjunct fellow of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote:  \"While claiming to face dire food shortages, Iraq actually exported food to other countries....Less than six months after the end of hostilities, the Security Council adopted resolutions to allow Iraq to sell its oil in order to provide revenue for the purchase of essential humanitarian supplies. The Iraqi government refused....Before the imposition of sanctions, the Iraqi government spent less than 25% of its income on humanitarian programs. Under the sanctions regime, Iraq was ordered to allocate 72% of its oil income for humanitarian projects. While there is plenty of money for meeting the needs of the Iraqi people, there is supposed to be none left over for obtaining weapons....While trying to pressure the Iraqi government to dispense with its WMD programs, the sanctions regime has also tried to force that same government to pay more attention to the needs of its own people. The health and welfare of those in Iraq has increased tremendously, at least when the Iraqi government does not interfere with the implementation of the oil-for-food program. It is difficult to be hungry when receiving oil-for-food rations....Barham Salih recently called the sanctions regime \"truly revolutionary\" in that \"never before in our history have we had a government obliged by international law to devote Iraq's oil revenues to the well being of the Iraqi people.\"....The per capita income available in Saddam's Iraq is now far higher than it was in Iraqi Kurdistan, and yet the Iraqi government continues to either not spend the revenue available, or not spend it wisely. Most damning to arguments about disproportionate funding in the north is that, according to Oil-for-food coordinators in Irbil, northern Iraq has so far only spent half the money actually allocated to it....The oil-for-food program has already spent more than $1 billion in water and sanitation projects in Iraq. There is no reason to blame sanctions for any degradation in water and sanitation systems.\"", "The UNICEF report on infant mortality was co-authored by the Iraqi government, and claimed that Kuwait was part of Iraq.

News reports at the time were skeptical about Kuwaiti assertions that the attack was planned by Iraq against former President Bush. Following is an interesting quote from Seymour Hersh's article from November 1993: Three years ago, during Iraq's six-month occupation of Kuwait, there had been an outcry when a teen-age Kuwaiti girl testified eloquently and effectively before Congress about Iraqi atrocities involving newborn infants. The girl turned out to be the daughter of the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Washington, Sheikh Saud Nasir al-Sabah, and her account of Iraqi soldiers flinging babies out of incubators was challenged as exaggerated both by journalists and by human rights groups. (Sheikh Saud was subsequently named Minister of Information in Kuwait, and he was the government official in charge of briefing the international press on the alleged assassination attempt against George Bush.) In a second incident, in August of 1991, Kuwait provoked a special session of the United Nations Security Council by claiming that twelve Iraqi vessels, including a speedboat, had been involved in an attempt to assault Bubiyan Island, long-disputed territory that was then under Kuwaiti control. The Security Council eventually concluded that, while the Iraqis had been provocative, there had been no Iraqi military raid, and that the Kuwaiti government knew there hadn't. What did take place was nothing more than a smuggler-versus-smuggler dispute over war booty in a nearby demilitarized zone that had emerged, after the Gulf War, as an illegal marketplace for alcohol, ammunition, and livestock. This establishes that, on several occasions, Kuwait has lied about the threat from Iraq. Hersh goes on to point out in the article numerous other times the Kuwaitis lied to the U.S. and the UN about Iraq. Here is another good quote from Hersh: The president was not alone in his caution. Janet Reno, the Attorney General, also had her doubts. \"The A.G remains skeptical of certain aspects of the case,\" a senior Justice Department official told me in late July, a month after the bombs were dropped on Baghdad...Two weeks later, what amounted to open warfare broke out among various factions in the government on the issue of who had done what in Kuwait. Someone gave a Boston Globe reporter access to a classified C.I.A. study that was highly skeptical of the Kuwaiti claims of an Iraqi assassination attempt. The study, prepared by the C.I.A.'s Counter Terrorism Center, suggested that Kuwait might have \"cooked the books \"on the alleged plot in an effort to play up the \"continuing Iraqi threat\" to Western interests in the Persian Gulf. Neither the Times nor the Post made any significant mention of the Globe Dispatch, which had been written by a Washington correspondent named Paul Quinn-Judge, although the story cited specific paragraphs from the C.I.A. assessment. The two major American newspapers had been driven by their sources to the other side of the debate. At the very least, the case against Iraq for the alleged bomb threat is not conclusive.

Iraq later admitted to the United Nations that it had made weapons out of all three... The CDC, meanwhile, sent shipments of germs to the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission and other agencies involved in Iraqs weapons of mass destruction programs. It sent samples in 1986 of botulinum toxin and botulinum toxoid-used to make vaccines against botulinum toxin-directly to the Iraqi chemical and biological weapons complex at al-Muthanna, the records show.

The U.S. military says attacks have fallen across Iraq by 60 percent since June on the back of security clampdowns and the deployment of 30,000 extra American troops.\" ", "  Proposed Baghdad reconstruction Plan", "2007 - Four years into the war, the biggest poll since coalition troops entered Iraq on March 20, 2003 showed that by a majority of two to one, Iraqis preferred the current leadership to Saddam Hussein's regime, regardless of the security situation and a lack of public services. It also revealed that contrary to the views of many western analysts, most Iraqis did not believe they were embroiled in a civil war; indeed, only 27% believed they were caught up in a civil war and 64% of the Iraqis still wanted to see a united Iraq under a central national government.", "ABC News (and USA Today) conducted a poll  and found that 56 percent of Iraqis did not believe there was a \u201ccivil war,\u201d and a British poll determined 61 percent did not believe they were in a civil war. The Times of London's summary of the poll: \u201cIraqis: life is getting better.\"  A version of the combined articles as posted by The Australian: \u201cIt's better than Saddam, say hopeful Iraqis.\u201d ", "On January 21, 2008 there was a report about a cache of documents discovered in the fall of 2007 by U.S. forces in the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar. It gave the individual records of 606 foreign fighters who entered Iraq between August 2006 and August 2007 saying, \"Based on the Sinjar records, U.S. military officials in Iraq said they now think that nine out of 10 suicide bombers have been foreigners, compared with earlier estimates of 75 percent.  Similarly, they assess that 90 percent of foreign fighters entering Iraq during the one-year period ending in August came via Syria, a greater proportion than previously believed. Although Saudi Arabia was by far the most common country of origin of foreign fighters, with about 40 percent of the total, a surprising share -- 19 percent -- came from Libya. Overall, about 40 percent were North African.\"  This certainly justifies these poll results where Iraqis stated that many of the attacks against the Iraqi populace are the work of foreign forces rather than out of the Iraqi population (civil war).", "Insurgency", "After the removal of Saddam, Iraq saw the rise of sectarian violence initiated by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's Sunni dominated al-Qaeda in Iraq faction and the majority Shia population. The strategy was to disrupt Iraq's economy and make the new democratic state ungovernable as long as the U.S. presence continued. The de-Ba'athification process excluded many Sunnis from leadership in the new Iraq. Some Sunnis viewed the U.S. suspiciously for supporting the Shia majority. Though a minority, the Sunni have traditionally ruled Iraq since 1922 and view themselves entitled to continue the privilege of doing so. There are also some intractable Sunni whose interpretation of Muslim law says that the Shia are considered heretics, and thus not fit to lead the nation. ", "Among the Shia majority, notably the Jaysh Al-Madhi, is a militant faction who not only attacked Sunni Muslims but also American and other coalition troops even while the coalition was protecting the democratically elected Shia. Other Shia groups that have not attacked coalition forces have pursued their own factional aims while relying on the US to ensure Shia majority rule, instead of seeking unity and a cohesive representatively fair national political structure, which hampered progress and reconciliation efforts.  ", "However, as reported on May 31, 2007, in the article \"US Eyes Cease-Fires End Violence in Iraq\" the No. 2 American commander, Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, said he thought 80 percent of Iraqis \u2014 including Sunni insurgents and Shia militants \u2014 can reach reconciliation. \"We are talking about cease-fires, and maybe signing some things that say they won't conduct operations against the government of Iraq or against coalition forces. I believe there are elements that are irreconcilable, but I believe the large majority are. I believe about 80 percent are reconcilable, both Jaysh Al-Madhi as well as Sunni insurgents.\"  ", "Propaganda", "Since the invasion in 2003, both Shiite and Sunni clerics have been repeating over and over again that the Americans and their mostly \"Christian\" allies are in Iraq to destroy Islam in its cultural heartland as well as to steal the country's oil. The clerics dismiss all talk of democracy and human rights by the invaders as mere hypocrisy\u2014except for women's rights, which are promoted in earnest, the clerics say, to induce Iraqi daughters and wives to dishonor their families by aping the shameless disobedience of Western women.", "At first, a majority of Iraqis believed these religious leaders. The alternative was difficult for them to believe\u2014that foreigners have been unselfishly expending their own blood and treasure to help them. Some polls and incidents demonstrate to insurgents that Americans are out to rob Muslim Iraqis not only of their territory and oil, but also of their religion and even their family honor. The most visible effects of these sentiments were the deadly attacks, the aiding and abetting of such attacks, and celebration by impromptu crowds of spectators. ", "Zarqawi and his successor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, now known as Caliph Ibrahim deliberately targeted innocent civilians, Iraqi police or the new National Army. Local clerics and others routinely accused the Americans of being the attackers\u2014usually by missile strikes that cleverly simulate car-bombs. As to why the Americans would want to kill Iraqis they are themselves recruiting, training, and paying, no explanation was offered, because no obligation was felt to unravel each and every sub-plot of the dark \"Christian conspiracy\" against Iraq, the Arab world, and Islam.", "One key to the success which caused a drop in violence by 2008  was the willingness of the Sunnis to take back their country from ISIL led violence. In an article February 10, 2008 called, \"U.S. Military Says Seized Docs Show Al Qaeda in Iraq Is Weakened\" it states, \"A diary and another document seized during U.S. raids show some Al Qaeda in Iraq leaders fear the terror group is crumbling, with many fighters defecting to American-backed neighborhood groups.\" ", "The reason for this shift, \"the author describes an Al Qaeda in crisis, with citizens growing weary of militants' presence and foreign fighters too eager to participate in suicide missions rather than continuing to fight, \"We lost cities and afterward, villages... We find ourselves in a wasteland desert,\" Smith quoted the document as saying. The memo \u2014 believed to have been written in summer 2007 \u2014 cites militants' increasing difficulty in moving around and transporting weapons and suicide belts because of better equipped Iraqi police and more watchful citizens, Smith said.\" ", "The populace of Iraq, with American support, rejected the extremist viewpoint and were willing to stand up and do what it takes to get peace in the country for themselves and their future. The article further states, \"The diary, seized by U.S. troops south of Balad, was written in autumn 2007 by Abu Tariq, who refers to himself as sector leader for al-Qaida in Iraq, Smith said. Tariq wrote that he was once in charge of 600 fighters, but only 20 were left \"after the tribes changed course\" \u2014 a reference to how many Sunni tribesmen have switched sides to fight alongside the Americans, Smith said. The new organizations, called awakening councils or neighborhood watch groups, were key to helping push Al Qaeda in Iraq out of Anbar province, once one of the country's most violent. The terror network's top leaders are now based somewhere in northern Iraq, Smith said, having moved out of Anbar and into Diyala province last year.", "The indomitable spirit of the Iraqis has been put to the test and is prevailing against ISIS as they stand up for their country and reject the extremist view and their brutal ways (including torture) which are documented in the next section.", "Most U.S. media companies have a significant stake in shaping the view of this conflict with the American public. Anti-Bush pro-DNC propaganda by U.S. media companies reported a common theme: American failure and defeat in Iraq. As the conflict continued the American public was given large doses of negative reporting for four years. During 2007, General Petraeus got approval and implemented the 'Surge' strategy for securing Baghdad from ISIS. Result, deaths and bombings by militias, rogue bandits and terror cells significantly decreased. Success was rarely reported.", "US troop surge and progress in Iraq", "See the article: Troop surge", "Since the new US-Iraqi offensive was launched in February 2007, ISIL forces were put on the defensive in their former insurgent strong\u00adhold of Anbar, Britain's top general in Iraq said (March 2007).

While conceding that car bomb attacks In Baghdad and a surge of violence in neighboring Diyala (Caliph Ibrahim's hometown) had to be addressed, he said that US and Iraqi planners were learning to reduce the threat, establishing an outer cordon around the city as well as barriers, or \u201cpoint defense\u201d protection around key targets inside. The US military has reported cases in which car bombs have been stopped at checkpoints. In some cases the bombs detonated killing Iraqi security forces, but the casualties would arguably have been much greater had the blasts hit crowded commercial districts.

The Islamic Army in Iraq, believed to be the largest group of former Baathists and army officers fighting Iraqi and US forces, called on Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader, to take more responsibility for al-Qaeda in Iraq. \u201cKilling Sunnis has become a legitimate target for them, especially rich ones.

Al-Shammari said they would be willing to deal with the Americans if certain conditions are met. Al-Shammari said that his group didn't consider US forces to be the main danger in Iraq. \"There are two occupations: Iranian and American, and the Iranian one is more dangerous than American because Iran considers Iraq as a part of their country.\" The Islamic Army in Iraq's statement comes after Iraq's president said the presidential office was in contact with five insurgent groups. Jalal Talabani said on Wednesday that the contacts mark an attempt to bring the groups into the mainstream political process.", "Additional progress was detailed in \"Corps Commander Highlights Progress in Iraq\", Apr 13, 2007, where Army Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the commander of Multinational Corps in Iraq said there has been progress in the security situation in Baghdad. Three of the five promised U.S. brigades are in place in the city, an additional three Iraqi brigade headquarters and 11 additional battalions have moved into Baghdad in support of the operation. Twenty-six joint security stations in Baghdad are manned by Iraqi army, Iraqi police and coalition forces, as are more than 21 combat outposts. \"This continuous presence is making the Iraqi people feel safer and has greatly increased the amount of information provided to the Iraqi army, police and coalition forces by the public,\" Odierno said. Sectarian murders have dropped in Baghdad, and some displaced families are returning to the city. In addition, coalition and Iraqi forces have doubled the number of arms caches found since the beginning of the operation two months ago. Security forces allow citizens to return to a more normal existence. \"Across Baghdad, markets are being hardened with checkpoints and barriers, and merchants have returned to sell their produce,\" he said. \"And Iraqis are busy shopping in the markets of Rusafa and Dura, and there are more projects such as these ... that will occur in the near future.\" ", "Positive changes are not limited to Baghdad, he said, they are also happening in Anbar province, where coalition and Iraqi security forces are working with local tribal leaders. \"The people of al Anbar are fighting back and winning,\" Odierno said. \"They've effectively turned back the tide of al Qaeda, but there will be counterattacks by al Qaeda.\" The general said there were nine attacks last week in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province. \"During the same week a year ago, there were over 84 attacks,\" he said. Odierno said he also sees promise in the northern part of Iraq. Coalition forces there have set up 33 U.S. police transition teams to build law enforcement capability in that region. Oil is flowing out of the Bayji refinery thanks to Iraqi security force efforts to protect distribution tankers. Progress continues in the country's south, as well. \"In the south, Operation Black Eagle in Diwaniyah, conducted by joint Iraqi and coalition forces, uncovered a headquarters of a rogue element of Jaysh al-Mahdi, with a major weapons cache including materials for IED-making,\" he said. Even the demonstrations called by radical cleric Muqtada al Sadr on April 9 to protest the U.S. presence in Iraq are a good sign, Odierno said. \"This demonstration took place without incident,\" he said. \"It is worth mentioning three points related to this demonstration. First, the government of Iraq allowed the demonstration to take place, unthinkable under the former regime. Second, the demonstrators waved Iraqi flags rather than black flags or pictures of ayatollahs. And third, the demonstrators numbered no more than 15,000, rather than the one million its organizers called for.\" ", "That being said, anti-democratic and sectarian violence in the war, as expected and predicted by the Bush Administration, is continuing: a recent Al-Qaida attack at the Parliamentary cafeteria killed one, and on April 18, 2007, a series of car bombs killed 131 Baghdad residents. ", "In the ABC article, \"Al-Qaida claims Iraq parliament attack\", the U.S. military revised the death toll sharply downward to one dead in the the parliament suicide bombing. Iraqi officials said the bomber was believed to have been a bodyguard for a Sunni lawmaker who was not among the casualties. Parliament officials said the victim was Mohammed Awad, a moderate Sunni lawmaker. Iraqi lawmakers gathered Friday in a rare - and defiant - session of parliament on the Muslim day of prayer. A red and white bouquet sat in Awad's place in the parliament chamber. Lawmakers took the podium one after another to denounce the bombing. One MP had his arm in sling and a woman lawmaker wore a neck brace. \"The more they (terrorists) act, the more solid we become. When they take from us one martyr, we will offer more martyrs,\" Vice President Adil Abdul-Mahdi said. \"The more they target our unity, the stronger our unity becomes.\" Iraqi parliament speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani said Friday's session was \"a clear message to all the terrorists and all those who dare try to stop this (political) process, that we will sacrifice in order for it to continue.\" ", "At a news conference with Defense Secretary Robert Gates (reported Fri Apr 20, 2007), Iraqi Defense Minister Abdul-Qader al-Obaidi said the Iraqis are making progress in countering the insurgency. \"Our need for support is getting less and less each day,\" al-Obaidi said. Gates said the U.S. troop buildup will continue at least until late summer. \"We need some time for things to work,\" he said. Three of the five extra brigades Bush ordered into Iraq to stem violence have arrived. Officials want the rest in place by June, for a total of 160,000. Soon after that, they will assess how much longer the higher troop level \u2014 about 30,000 more than before the buildup \u2014 will be needed. Since the troop buildup or \"Surge\" has not even been completed, it is not surprising that the premature and rash comments by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid saying the war was already lost and the troop buildup was not stemming violence in Iraq were rejected by Gates. \"I respectfully disagree,\" Gates said when asked by a reporter about Reid's Thursday remarks. He assured al-Maliki that the U.S. continues to be committed to the Iraqi government and the Baghdad security plan, Gates said.", "April 20, 2007 - Iraqi President Nouri al Malaki affirmed the indigenous Iraqi Assyrian Christians' right to have a Province of their own, which could be provided for under the Iraqi Constitution.

Additionally, Malaki said, \"I think it is important to let the world know that things in our country are improving dramatically. Our unemployment rate has gone from nearly 70 percent to now under 30 percent. Our most recent growth rate was 3 percent and we have seen, in particular as a result of the recent Baghdad program, a dramatic drop in so-called sectarian violence. What is particularly encouraging to me is the changes we have seen in our security forces and the trust from our people once again. We are finally seeing individual citizens provide information to our forces, which has changed the situation dramatically in rooting out those who are determined to ruin our country.\"", "Malaki stressed three key goals. National Reconciliation, Economic Development and Expanded Security as the way forward. \"In spite of much information to the contrary, we are seeing a return to the Iraq we all once knew when we considered ourselves all Iraqis and not belonging to a particular sect or group,\" he said. \"Recently we have brought back large numbers of former members of the Ba'ath Party who were not involved in any problems in the past and this has significantly helped to bring our people together. Economic development is taking place at a good rate. Part of the reason we are here is to encourage even more investment into our country. The monthly income of our people has gone from about $20 a month to now over $200. The dramatic rise in electrical use is one good sign that the economy is taking off. The stores are full.\" Describing the current military situation as \"moving from sectarian to outside interference,\" Malaki stressed that the so-called Baghdad Plan was working. \"We are seeing a dramatic drop in the sectarian conflicts and see our major challenge as that from the outside including Al Quaida and remainders of the Ba'athist groups,\" he said. \"In the end we will be able to take care of ourselves.

Petraeus also stated that he was uncertain whether his counterinsurgency strategy would be ultimately succeed, but he stated \"We have certainly pulled  neighborhoods back from the brink.\" Assessing the first two months of the U.S. and Iraqi plan to pacify the capital, senior American commanders\u2014including Petraeus; Adm. William Fallon, head of U.S. forces in the Middle East; Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, commander of military operations in Iraq; and top regional commanders\u2014see mixed results. Critical now, they said in interviews last week, is for Iraqi leaders to forge the political compromises needed for long-term stability. The deployment of additional troops in Baghdad is only 60 percent complete, and a major concern shared by U.S. military leaders is whether al-Maliki's government is capable of solidifying gains in security as well as making the crucial political compromises needed to achieve peace.

Odierno noted that efforts to engage tribal leaders in Anbar province \u2014 who have been turning against al-Qaida there \u2014 has helped draw people to serve in the Iraqi security forces in record numbers and has helped reduce attacks there. For example, the attacks in Anbar in May 2006 totaled 811, while this May they were just barely over 400.

However, working toward forcing cooperation by the populace, the terrorists in Iraq have used incredible amounts of intimidation - kidnap, torture, threats and murder - to prevent the local Iraqi populace from cooperating with those who will bring them a free and democratic Iraq (the US/Coalition forces and the Democratically aligned Iraqi government forces). From the ordinary Iraqi's point of view, cooperating with those who will bring them freedom can have a high cost. If found out, the media will splash their name all over the papers, making it easy for the terrorists to target them for reprisals. Family members can go missing or they can. They could be tortured or killed. ", "The great tragedy in the Mainstream Media (MSM) covering up the inhumane torture methods of the terrorists while trumpeting outrage at the far milder US intimidation techniques (Abu Gharib, etc.), is that it hides from public view what risks the Iraqi population must take to cooperate with those who would bring them their freedom. In the article, \"Media Totally Ignore Al Qaeda Torture Manual\" it says, \"Glenn Reynolds this morning pointed out that \u201cSilence is complicity,\u201d while leading the reader to Don Surber's piece on the subject which went much further in condemning the media boycott (emphasis added): And yet such false stories as the \u201cflushed Koran\u201d got widespread play in the newspapers and on television. We are hearing those awful \u201cSounds of Silence\u201d that Simon and Garfunkel warned us about. Whether intentional or not, the message is clear: The United States must be above even false reports of torture, while the enemy is allowed to promote eye removal, blowtorching skin and horrors I won't go into. The handbook shows that the enemy really is perverted; they are sickos who like to torture people. As much as I admire and respect John McCain's war service, he is wrong when he says our interrogation methods encourage the enemy to torture our people. The enemy was torturing and beheading people well before 9/11.\"", "Apart from brief mentions on Fox News and CNN, reports on this issue in the days prior or subsequent have been few. As a result, the populace of the US sees daily news coverage of just how ruthless the insurgents are in their attacks upon the populace in the way of guns and bombs, but are not given substantive evidence of the intimidation (torture) which the Iraqi people face. And it is this torture and intimidation which was the direct cause of slowing US progress, hampering the swift end of the insurgency in Iraq. Thinking that the people of Iraq support the insurgency and are not merely being intimidated by them, the US populace has been impatient for instant progress and their support for the Iraqi people obtaining their freedom from such a ruthless enemy waned. As a result\u2014before the success of the surge, the drop in violence and the standing up of the Iraqis against this intimidation - US support for the war dropped significantly and many discouraged American people turned to supporting the anti-American sentiments of the far left saying America should pull the troops from Iraq.", "Results of the Surge on casualties and terrorist attacks", "The surge has resulted in a 60% reduction in terrorist attacks and causalities since June 2007 to the present.  Indeed, the year 2008 saw a decline in soldier deaths to 309 from 906 the year before.", "Many insurgents returned to Libya, Syria, and other places of origin to continue jihad against Muammar Gaddafi, Bashar al Assad and other secular rulers.", "Iraq Strategy in Relation to the Global War on Terrorism", "As reported in the State Department's annual Country Reports on Terrorism  released April 30, 2007, there are steep declines in terrorist attacks and murders in many regions of the globe. Though terrorism has increased markedly in Iraq, aside from the Middle East (which does not include Afghanistan according to State), the number of terrorist attacks worldwide is down from a year ago by over 300 incidents. In other words, the Bush administration's idea that making Iraq the \"central front in the war on terror\" seems to be working. According to the State report, terrorism in South Asia is down by 10 percent from a year ago. In Europe, it's down 18 percent. In Central and South America, terrorism-related deaths are down 54 percent.

But recently in July 2008, The USA Military found 550 metric tons of yellow cake uranium and parts to make nuclear weapons in Tuwaitha 12 miles south of Baghdad, as proof that George W. Bush, Tony Blair, and the CIA were right about Saddam owning yellow cake uranium. An article 07/08/2008 states, \"In recent weeks, the U.S. secretly has helped the Iraqi government ship it all to Canada, where it was bought by a Canadian company for further processing into nuclear fuel \u2014 thus keeping it from potential use by terrorists or unsavory regimes in the region. The scary math behind Saddam's uranium hoard: 500 tons of yellowcake, once refined, could make 142 nuclear weapons. This would seem to vindicate Bush's decision to invade.

The offer, \"guaranteed Iraq a weapons-assembly line capable of producing nuclear warheads in as little as three years.\" At the time of the 1990 offer, Iraq was embarked in a crash program to develop nuclear weapons and \"Iraqi officials at the time appear to have taken the offer seriously and asked the Pakistanis for sample drawings as proof of their ability to deliver.\" The article goes on to state that \"Aid from the Pakistani scientist could have accelerated Iraq's quest for a weapon if the Iraqi leader had not run out of time, writes Albright, a former U.N. inspector who now heads the nonprofit Institute for Science and International Security.\"", "", "Additionally, concerning the 36 million captured pages of documentation, when it was put on the net for public translation, it was removed after they found quote, \"detailed accounts of Iraq\u2019s secret nuclear research before the 1991 Persian Gulf war.

In the \"Nightline\" version of the 1996 recording, Saddam predicts that Washington, D.C., would be hit by terrorists. But he adds that Iraq would have nothing to do with the attack. Tierney says, however, that what Saddam actually said was much more sinister. \"He was discussing his intent to use chemical weapons against the United States and use proxies so it could not be traced back to Iraq,\" he told Hannity. In a passage not used by \"Nightline,\" Tierney says Saddam declares: \"Terrorism is coming. ... In the future there will be terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.

", "Both Duelfer and Kay found Iraq had \"a clandestine network of laboratories and safe houses with equipment that was suitable to continuing its prohibited chemical- and biological-weapons  programs,\" the official said. \"They found a prison laboratory where we suspect they tested biological weapons on human subjects.\"  \"Reference strains\" of a wide variety of biological-weapons agents were found beneath the sink in the home of a prominent Iraqi BW scientist. \"We thought it was a big deal,\" a senior administration official said. \"But it has been written off  as a sort of 'starter set.'\" They found equipment for \"uranium-enrichment centrifuges\" whose only plausible use was as part of a clandestine nuclear-weapons program. In all these cases, \"Iraqi scientists had been told before the war not to declare their activities to the U.N. inspectors,\" the official said. ", "In testimony before Congress on March 30, Duelfer revealed the ISG had found evidence of a \"crash program\" to construct new plants capable of making chemical- and biological-warfare agents. The ISG also found a previously undeclared program to build a \"high-speed rail gun,\" a device apparently designed for testing nuclear-weapons materials. That came in addition to 500 tons of natural uranium stockpiled at Iraq's main declared nuclear site south of Baghdad.", "How did this happen? According to the Duelfer Report, half of the picture rests with entities outside Iraq. Saddam was trying to end the UN sanctions to pursue his conventional, dual-use, and WMD-related programs. In Saddam's efforts to influence United Nations Security Council  members - namely Russia, France, and China - to end sanctions, Saddam's ordered the Iraq Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to formulate and implement a strategy aimed at these Security Council members and international public opinion with the purpose of ending UN sanctions by diplomatic and economic means.  Saddam also made use of \u201cProtocols\u201d or government-to-government economic trade agreements to generate a large amount of revenue outside the purview of the UN.  His success emboldened Saddam to pursue his reconstitution efforts of conventional, dual-use, and WMD-related programs starting in 1997. Quote: \"By 2000-2001, Saddam had managed to mitigate many of the effects of sanctions and undermine their international support,\" the (Duelfer) report said. ", "The Regime's authorities devised front companies that had close relationships with foreign government officials who worked to procure illicit goods, services, and technologies for Iraq's WMD-related, conventional arms, and/or dual-use goods programs. Saddam used the Mukhabarat, or Iraqi Intelligence Servise (IIS) to  facilitate importation of UN sanctioned and dual-use goods through Syria, Jordan, Belarus, Turkey and others.  Numerous foreign trade intermediaries disguised illicit items, hid the identity of the end user, and/or changed the final destination of the item to move it to the region. For a cut of the profits they smuggled prohibited items to entry points along the Iraqi border.  Companies in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, UAE, and Yemen assisted Saddam with the acquisition of prohibited items through deceptive trade practices. In the case of Syria and Yemen, this included support from agencies or personnel within the government itself.", "Regime Intent", "The Iraqi Survey Group in interrogations of Ba'athist officials from the leadership of the intelligence and security services, and Qusay's inner circle, undertook interviews of Ba'athists in custody.  Some detainees\u2019 statements were made to minimize their culpability leading to potential prosecution. Detainees were very concerned about their fate and were not willing to implicate themselves in sensitive matters of interest such as WMD, in light of looming prosecutions. Debriefers noted the tendency to place blame or knowledge with individuals who were not in a position to contradict the detainee's statements, such as deceased individuals or individuals who were not in custody or who had fled the country, or providing debriefers with previously known information. Some former high-ranking officials, such as \u2018Ali Hasan Al Majid Al Tikriti (Chemical \u2018Ali), never gave substantial information, despite speaking colorfully and at length. Some obstructed all attempts to elicit information on WMD and illicit activities of the former Regime. Others, however, were keen to help clarify every issue, sometimes to the point of self-incrimination.", "The ISG's key findings stated that Saddam never abandoned his intentions to resume a chemical weapons effort when sanctions were lifted. Saddam and many Iraqis regarded chemical weapons  as a proven weapon against an enemy's superior numerical strength, a weapon that had saved the nation at least once already\u2014during the Iran-Iraq war\u2014 and contributed to deterring the Coalition in 1991 from advancing to Baghdad.  After 1991, Saddam did express his intent to retain the intellectual capital, or the know-how that was developed during the Iraqi Nuclear Program. Saddam indicated that he would develop the weapons necessary to counter any Iranian threat.  Starting around 1992, in a bid to retain the intellectual core of the former weapons program workers with know-how, Baghdad transferred many nuclear scientists to related jobs in the Military Industrial Commission (MIC). The work undertaken by these scientists at the MIC helped them maintain their weapons knowledge base. The Regime prevented scientists from the former nuclear weapons program from leaving either their jobs or Iraq. Moreover, in the late 1990s, personnel from both MIC and the IAEC received significant pay raises in a bid to retain them, and the Regime undertook new investments in university research in a bid to ensure that Iraq retained technical knowledge.", "The way Iraq organized its chemical industry after the mid-1990s allowed it to conserve the knowledge-base needed to restart a CW program, conduct a modest amount of dual-use research, and partially recover from the decline of its production capability caused by the effects of the Gulf war and UN-sponsored destruction and sanctions. Iraq implemented a rigorous and formalized system of nationwide research and production of chemicals. The Regime employed a cadre of trained and experienced researchers, production managers, and weaponization experts from the former CW program. Iraq constructed a number of new plants starting in the mid-1990s that enhanced its chemical infrastructure.  ", "ISG judged, based on available chemicals, infrastructure, and scientist debriefings, that Iraq at OIF probably had a capability to produce large quantities of sulfur mustard within three to six months.  A former nerve agent expert indicated that Iraq retained the capability to produce nerve agent in significant quantities within two years, given the import of required phosphorus precursors. However, we have no credible indications that Iraq acquired or attempted to acquire large quantities of these chemicals through its existing procurement networks for sanctioned items. In addition to new investment in its industry, Iraq was able to monitor the location and use of all existing dualuse process equipment. This provided Iraq the ability to rapidly reallocate key equipment for proscribed activities, if required by the Regime.", "Iraq's historical ability to implement simple solutions to weaponization challenges allowed Iraq to retain the capability to weaponize CW agent when the need arose.  Iraq could indigenously produce a range of conventional munitions, throughout the 1990s, many of which had previously been adapted for filling with CW agent. ", "Saddam's Leadership Defense Plan consisted of a tactical doctrine taught to all Iraqi officers and included the concept of a \u201cred-line\u201d or last line of defense. Uday \u2014 head of the Fedayeen Saddam \u2014 attempted to obtain chemical weapons for use during OIF.  ISG uncovered information that the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) maintained throughout 1991 to 2003 a set of undeclared covert laboratories to research and test various chemicals and poisons, primarily for intelligence operations. The existence, function, and purpose of the laboratories of which were never declared to the UN. The IIS program included the use of human subjects for testing purposes. ", "The IIS provided the BW program with security and participated in biological research, probably for its own purposes, from the beginning of Iraq's BW effort in the early 1970s until the final days of Saddam Husayn's Regime. In 1991, Saddam Husayn regarded BW as an integral element of his arsenal of WMD weapons, and would have used it if the need arose. At a meeting of the Iraqi leadership immediately prior to the Gulf war in 1991, Saddam Husayn personally authorized the use of BW weapons against Israel, Saudi Arabia and US forces.  Saddam envisaged all-out use. For example, all Israeli cities were to be struck and all the BW weapons at his disposal were to be used. Saddam specified that the \u201cmany years\u201d agents, presumably anthrax spores, were to be employed against his foes. ISG judged that Iraq's actions between 1991 and 1996 demonstrate that the state intended to preserve its BW capability and return to a steady, methodical progress toward a mature BW program when and if the opportunity arose.", "Misreporting the Duelfer Report", "As The Washington Times reported in their editorial titled \"Misreporting the Duelfer Report\"  the day following its release, October 8, 2004, quote: \"\"Gotcha, Mr. President.\" This was the consensus of the headlines from nearly every daily newspaper yesterday responding to the CIA's Iraq Survey Group report on Iraq's prewar weapons programs. Yes, the report found no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq since the war began in March 2003. But were these the findings that the report highlighted in the first line of its Key Findings summary? No. \"Saddam  so dominated the Iraqi Regime that its strategic intent was his alone,\" the summary begins. \"He wanted to end sanctions while preserving the capability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) when sanctions were lifted.\" This hardly sounds as if the Iraq Survey Group, headed by Charles A. Duelfer, thought Saddam was cooperating with the international community. ", "The article goes on to explain that Saddam was attempting to get the sanctions lifted, targeting the three members of the Security Council - France, China and Russia - and then he intended to use the Oil for Food program \"to acquire foreign exchange both to further undermine sanctions and to provide the means to enhance dual-use infrastructure and potential WMD-related development.\" Then notes, \"While the United Nations turned a blind eye, Saddam cheated and committed mass murder in an effort to achieve his goals. To suggest that \"containment\" could have been sustained without dire results verges on the delusional. There is a very pertinent lesson in the Duelfer report; too bad no one told the headline writers.\"", "Threat Level Concern", "It is worth noting the following concerning a current controversy about the level of threat Saddam posed. If you consider the terrorists as various minority factions all working toward the same goal, as stated by Mr. Kraft on this page when he says, \"there is a very dangerous minority in Islam that either has, or wants and may soon have, the ability to deliver small nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons almost anywhere in the world, unless they are prevented from doing so.\" It doesn't matter which of these factions would have been used to specifically target the civilized world in a nuclear or biological/chemical attack. Although recently the extent of Saddam's ties to one specific group (the Al-Qaeda terrorists) has been questioned and a recent article stated that the Iraqi government and al-Qaeda figures had only limited contacts, the same article goes on to say concerning Al-Qaeda that \"it lacked evidence of a long-term relationship like the ones Iraq had forged with other terrorist groups.\"  Therefore, it is known that Saddam had forged long term relationships with known terrorist GROUPS (plural) and so it was not that there was no threat from any terrorists groups, just that the threat would have come from those OTHER terrorists as the threat to the collective security of the civilized world if the US hadn't taken out Saddam. ", "It also remains to be seen if the ties with Al-Qaeda would have remained \"limited\" if that group had stepped up and volunteered to take the completed nuclear weapons from Saddam (which he would have had within a year according to The New York Times - see the WMD section, this page) into Washington and detonate them using sophisticated and existing sleeper cell suicide bombers as Saddam was contemplating. It appears likely that Saddam would have listened and handed them his stocks of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons by his statements (see Mr. Tierney's translation on this page). From his past actions, Saddam was an equal opportunity employer for all the terrorist groups.. including those they admit in this report with whom he had \"long-term relationships.\" As Mr. Kraft observes, it is many \"barbarians\" at our gates with sophisticated weapons of mass destruction for the first time, not only one group (Al-Qaeda.) It is global in scope, hence the reason for calling this a \"Global War on Terror\" not a \"War on Terror in Iraq.\" As such, it is a fight for world supremacy, and the civilized world would do well not to ignore or minimize what the civilized world is fighting over.", "Accusations of Cover-Ups", "While both parties continue to squabble over the above documents and claims, quote, \"Both Republicans and Democrats charged the other side was trying using the release of more information for its political purposes,\"  there were others who claimed there were cover-ups happening to stop further evidence becoming public. A NYsun article states, \"A former special investigator for the Pentagon during the Iraq war said he found four sealed underground bunkers in southern Iraq that he is sure contain stocks of chemical and biological weapons. But when he asked American weapons inspectors to check out the sites, he was rebuffed. Between March and July 2003, Mr. Gaubatz was taken by (his) sources to four locations - three in and around Nasiriyah and one near the port of Umm Qasr, where he was shown underground concrete bunkers with the tunnels leading to them deliberately flooded. In each case, he was told the facilities contained stocks of biological and chemical weapons, along with missiles whose range exceeded that mandated under U.N. sanctions. But because the facilities were sealed off with concrete walls, in some cases up to 5 feet thick, he did not get inside. He filed reports with photographs, exact grid coordinates, and testimony from multiple sources. And then he waited for the Iraq Survey Group to come to the sites. \"I have no doubts the sites were never exploited by ISG. We agents begged and begged for weeks and months to get ISG to respond to the sites with the proper equipment,\" Mr. Gaubatz said in a telephone interview. \"An adequate search would have required heavy equipment to uncover the concrete, and additional equipment to drain the water.\" Mr. Gaubatz would not disclose the names of his Iraqi sources, but he said they were \"highly credible\" by his supervisors.", "In the exhaustive search for WMDs in Iraq, CNN has left all stones unturned - or have they? These are the words right out of the mouth of CNN reporter Jane Arraf, quote: \"And if you had a bureau there, like we did, and it was a known bureau and a known company like CNN was, it was a beacon for everybody. It was a beacon for Iraqis who believed they had stories. Iraqis would show up, there would be Iraqis lined up outside the door. There... would be the Iraqis who told you they had nuclear documents in their basement and would you like to come and look . You know, there was almost that pang when you turned somebody away,  thinking, \u201cDamn, maybe this guy really does have nuclear weapons in his basement, but I don\u2019t have time.\u201d So you never really knew.\"", "Costs", "(Needs more statistics)", "Since the war is not yet over, the total cost has yet to be tallied.  However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the war has, as of 3/12/2007, cost less than $400 Billion. The National Priorities Project, though, indicates that the war costs some $195,000 per minute, according to numbers based on Congressional appropriations, and the tally had reached $412.8 billion as of 3/30/2007.  A 2008 study estimated that the Iraq War cost the United States $12 billion a month. This makes the Iraq war the most expensive endeavor in U.S. history.", "Death Toll Under Saddam Versus War", "According to the current government of Iraq, it is estimated that well over one million Iraqis were murdered by or \"disappeared\" under the rule of Saddam's regime. By the time of the invasion, Saddam's regime was killing people at a rate of 15 to 20 thousand per year. According to the US Army War College, the 1988 gassing of the Kurds was greatly exaggerated.  ", "Methods of torture employed by Saddam's regime included:  amputation of tongues, crucifixion, eye-gouging, genital electric shock, gang rape, mutilation with electric drills and vats of acid, imprisonment in confined spaces in darkness for years at a time, and the amputation of limbs. However, the shredder turned out to be false.  ", "Veteran BBC correspondent John Sweeney said during Saddam's rule:  \"I have been to Baghdad a number of times. Being in Iraq is like creeping around inside someone else\u2019s migraine. The fear is so omnipresent you could almost eat it. No one talks.\"", "Saddam's deliberate manipulation of the sanctions regime cost the lives of tens if not hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, most of whom were women and children.   Researcher Richard Garfield estimated \"a minimum of 100,000 and a more likely estimate of 227,000 excess deaths among young children from August 1991 through March 1998\" from all causes including sanctions.  It is a matter of public record that the sanctions specifically exempted food and medicine; that they applied only to weaponry; that Iraq had far more humanitarian supplies available to it under the Oil For Food program (first offered to Iraq in 1992) than it would have had over the same period based on the trends that existed before the Gulf War; and that excess deaths did not occur in the North of Iraq, where the US and UN administered the same program under the same sanctions regime, but only in those parts of Iraq were Saddam was charged with rationing the humanitarian supplies.  The number of deaths Saddam caused by refusing to allow aid to reach his people for propaganda purposes is disputed, but his cynical nature can be observed by the fact that he wildly exaggerated the number of people he was killing in order to blame them all on the UN and US.  Since the fall of Saddam, independent research from the CIA has found that roughly 5,000 children were dying every year from Saddam's manipulation of the sanctions, in addition to the 3 or 4 times that number he was killing annually by other means.  Therefore, by 2013, Saddam would have killed (roughly) between 200,000 and 250,000 Iraqis had he remained in power.", "It has long been suspected that Saddam, based on his annual rate of killing, must have killed (conservatively) at least half a million people in executions.  Since his fall, the Documental Center For Human Rights in Iraq and other human rights organizations have been able to document more than 600,000 political murders perpetrated by the former regime based on its own records.  The real toll may be higher.  In addition, Saddam's bloody purges and pogroms against the Kurds (including the Anfal campaign, in which as many as 182,000 were killed) throughout the eighties and early nineties, left as many as 300,000 dead.  Saddam's 1991 crackdown killed 90,000 or more individuals, while the Gulf War killed roughly 10,000 including 2,000 Kuwaiti and 1,000 Iraqi civilians.  If one assumes that Saddam's manipulation of the sanctions regime resulted in the deaths of about 200,000 Iraqis, in total Saddam was probably responsible for the deaths of over 1,200,000 Iraqis, or 5% of the population.", "Coalition Troop Casualties", "  Iraq War Memorial Lafayette CA.", "According to the US Department of Defense, over 4,200 U.S. and 300 troops from coalition countries have died in the war.  Over 30,000 U.S. troops have been wounded in combat.  Despite a dramatic decrease in violence in the latter half of the year, 2007 was the worst year in Iraq in terms of U.S. casualties.  Over 900 American troops died or went missing in action during the year.", "Enemy Casualties", "In March, 2007, Larry Schweikart, Professor of History at the University of Dayton and a military historian, calculated that, \"a low estimate of 30,000 terrorists have been killed since 9/11, and an upperbound number of 60,000.  On top of that, between 120 and 240,000 terrorists have been wounded.  This is where it gets tricky.  Likely because their medicine isn\u2019t as good as ours, they have a higher death rate among wounded, which probably means that instead of 1 out of 8 dying of wounds, it\u2019s more like 3 out of 8, and that number is in my first set of stats.  In addition, we have captured close to 50,000 terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq since 9/11, and since the beginning of hostilities in Iraq, using traditional desertion rates, I figure at least another 10,000 jihadists have put away the old IED and gone home.  So, a low estimate is that we have removed from the order of battle about 210,000 on the low end to 360,000 on the high end.  This is an entire generation of jihadists, and will, if nothing else, significantly feminize Muslim society.\"", "Civilian Casualties", "The anti-war Iraq Body Count website has chronicled and tallied virtually all reported Iraqi civilian deaths from the war that have multiple sources in print, coming to a present total of 98-107,000 deaths.  However, this sum certainly understates the case to a considerable extent, given that the total number of deaths could not all have been reported and tallied.  On November 11, 2006, Iraqi Health Minister Ali al-Shamari estimated that between 100,000 and 150,000 civilians had been killed during the war.  A 2008 estimate by the World Health Organization placed the civilian death toll at 151,000.", "Based on a careful analysis of IBC's figures, only 1-2% of Iraqi civilian deaths during the occupation were caused by US troops, and the rest by the insurgency they were combating.  The American army in Iraq has taken three times as many casualties as it has inflicted on Iraqi civilians in collateral damage, which must be a first in the history of military occupation.  The US invasion killed an additional  3,000 to 7,000 Iraqi civilians, and at least 7,600\u201310,800 Iraqi combatants.", "In 2006, the Lancet medical journal published an extremely high estimate of 655,000 civilian deaths caused by the war.  These figures have been extensively discredited, with the following summary from the IBC being the most succicent explanation:", "The Iraqi mortality estimates published in the Lancet in October 2006 imply, among other things, that: ", "On average, a thousand Iraqis have been violently killed every single day in the first half of 2006, with less than a tenth of them being noticed by any public surveillance mechanisms; some 800,000 or more Iraqis suffered blast wounds and other serious conflict-related injuries in the past two years, but less than a tenth of them received any kind of hospital treatment; over 7% of the entire adult male population of Iraq has already been killed in violence, with no less than 10% in the worst affected areas covering most of central Iraq; half a million death certificates were received by families which were never officially recorded as having been issued; the Coalition has killed far more Iraqis in the last year than in earlier years containing the initial massive \"Shock and Awe\" invasion and the major assaults on Falluja.  If these assertions are true, they further imply:  Incompetence and/or fraud on a truly massive scale by Iraqi officials in hospitals and ministries, on a local, regional and national level, perfectly coordinated from the moment the occupation began; bizarre and self-destructive behaviour on the part of all but a small minority of 800,000 injured, mostly non-combatant, Iraqis; the utter failure of local or external agencies to notice and respond to a decimation of the adult male population in key urban areas; and an abject failure of the media, Iraqi as well as international, to observe that Coalition-caused events of the scale they reported during the three-week invasion in 2003 have been occurring every month for over a year.  In the light of such extreme and improbable implications, a rational alternative conclusion to be considered is that the authors have drawn conclusions from unrepresentative data. In addition, totals of the magnitude generated by this study are unnecessary to brand the invasion and occupation of Iraq a human and strategic tragedy. ", "In September 2011, the Lancet themselves retracted this overinflated casualty figure, revising it down from 655,000 to 108,624, quote, \"The corrupt Lancet journal this week announced that 108,624 Iraqis were killed during the Iraq War not 655,000 as they previously reported.

Because this was three times higher than the IBC estimate at the time, it would indicate a total sum of approximately 300,000 Iraqis as of today.  This is probably an absolute maximum estimate because the ratio of 1 out of every 3 deaths being recorded by the IBC has been altered considerably by the great decline in violence following the surge, so that the IBC's recent figures are much more inclusive of the total sum than its earlier findings.", "Columnist Christopher Hitchens, who supports the war, has boldly argued that the estimates of the death toll are irrelevant:", "Here is the clinching and obvious point:  Saddam Hussein is not going to survive. His regime is on the verge of implosion. It has long passed the point of diminishing returns. Like the Ceausescu edifice in Romania, it is a pyramid balanced on its apex (its powerbase a minority of the Sunni minority), and when it falls, all the consequences of a post-Saddam Iraq will be with us anyway. To suggest that these consequences\u2014-Sunni-Shi'a rivalry, conflict over the boundaries of Kurdistan, possible meddling from Turkey or Iran, vertiginous fluctuations in oil prices and production, social chaos\u2014-are attributable only to intervention is to be completely blind to the impending reality.

The section on The Duelfer Report points out that there were reference strains of biological agents which were found and evidence of the ability to quickly start chemical and biological warfare production, QUOTE: Both Duelfer and Kay found Iraq had \"a clandestine network of laboratories and safe houses with equipment that was suitable to continuing its prohibited chemical- and biological-weapons  programs,\" the official said. \"They found a prison laboratory where we suspect they tested biological weapons on human subjects.\" \"Reference strains\" of a wide variety of biological-weapons agents were found beneath the sink in the home of a prominent Iraqi BW scientist. In testimony before Congress on March 30, Duelfer revealed the ISG had found evidence of a \"crash program\" to construct new plants capable of making chemical- and biological-warfare agents (end quote)", "Saddam's son in law tells Saddam, quote: In the chemical, sir, they have a problem far bigger than the biological, bigger than the biological. Not the type of the weapons, not the volume of the materials we imported, not the volume of the production we told them about, not the volume of use. None of this was correct. They don't know any of this. We did not reveal the volume of the chemical weapons that we had produced. We did not reveal the type of the chemical weapons. We did not reveal the truth about the volume of the imported materials. In the nuclear, sir, in the biological, we also disagree with them. As for the nuclear, we say we have disclosed everything but no. There are teams working with no one knowing about some of them. I go back to the question of whether we should reveal everything or continue to be silent... I would say it is in our interest not to reveal. Not just out of fear of disclosing the technology we achieved, or to hide it for future work... (end quote)", "Also, there is credible testimony that Saddam had the weapons and moved them, quote: Saddam Hussein's former southern regional commander, Gen. Al-Tikriti, gave the first videotaped testimony confirming that Iraq had WMDs up to the American invasion in 2003 and that Russia helped remove them prior to the war. His testimony confirms numerous other sources that have pointed to Russia's secret alliance with Iraq and the co-ordinated moving of WMDs before the American liberation.\"  (end quote)", "There are those who think that attacks upon America must actually happen in order to prove that these things exist or pose an imminent threat. The Iraq War was a preventative war and as such its merit relies on the mental ability of the public to perceive future threats and act in keeping with that threat and not ignore it - just as a person must swerve their car in the face of oncoming traffic in order to avoid an accident. As with this example, it does little good to discuss the merits of whether there would have been a crash or not after the fact since the evidence of past destruction which was avoided will never be obtainable.", "The threats could be real or invented; Destroying an Arab country is the safest way to avoid any future damage.", "New Middle East Project", "Three years after the start of the war, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced Colonel Ralph Peters New Middle East Project, a continuation of the World War I Sykes-Picot Agreement, in which he admits to the title \"Blood Borders\".", "10 Years After the Invasion", "America destroyed Iraq but the war crimes remain unacknowledged and unpunished. The evil unleashed on the people of Iraq has been painstakingly obscured behind a tapestry of lies.  While Iraqis are still grieving over those who died during the decade-long war, ongoing violence in the region means the death-toll keeps rising. At least 134,000 Iraqi civilians are estimated to have died in the conflict and the overall number of casualties could be four times higher.

Health and infrastructure are also on that list, according to the Costs of War Project, which goes on to say \u201cthe $212 billion reconstruction effort was largely a failure with most of that money spent on security or lost to waste and fraud.", "Less than 40 per cent of Iraqi adults have a job and a quarter of families live below the World Bank\u2019s poverty line. Statistics that haven\u2019t improved much since the days of crushing UN sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990. "]}
