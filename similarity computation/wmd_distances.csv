Voluntary euthanasia has been legalized in the Netherlands and Belgium, where large majorities of the population support the right of terminally ill patients to die at a moment of their own choosing, and in Switzerland and the US state of Oregon, where the people explicitly endorsed legalization in plebiscites.  Legalized euthanasia has limitations on when it may be used, such as the approval of a number of physicians when a terminally ill patient suffers from excruciating pain. Opponents of euthanasia maintain that this rarely constitutes an obstacle, as in practice all it requires is a few physicians to authorize it, and that legalization thus violates the sanctity of human life. They also fear legalization could be a slippery slope, leading to the planned and involuntary termination of all life that is deemed ""unworthy"", as in the Nazis' program to kill the mentally and physically handicapped. Supporters of legalized voluntary euthanasia, on the other hand, feel that a complete ban would unnecessarily prolong the suffering of some terminally ill patients and thus contravene the Gospel's teaching of compassion. They are convinced that the rule of law in democratic societies prevents excesses such as the euthanasia program of Nazi Germany.
